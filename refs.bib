   abstract = {Insects and other small invertebrates are ubiquitous components of all terrestrial and freshwater food webs, but their cumulative biomass is small relative to plants and microbes. As a result, it is often assumed that these animals make relatively minor contributions to ecosystem processes. Despite their small sizes and cumulative biomass, we suggest that these animals may commonly have important effects on carbon and nutrient cycling by modulating the quality and quantity of resources that enter the detrital food web, with consequences at the ecosystem level. These effects can occur through multiple pathways, including direct inputs of insect biomass, the transformation of detrital biomass, and the indirect effects of predators on herbivores and detritivores. In virtually all cases, the ecosystem effects of these pathways are ultimately mediated through interactions with plants and soil microbes. Merging our understanding of insect, plant and microbial ecology will offer a valuable way to better integrate community-level interactions with ecosystem processes. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Small populations are predicted to have reduced capacity to adapt to environmental change for two reasons. First, population genetic models indicate that genetic variation and potential response to selection should be positively correlated with population size. The empirical support for this prediction is mixed: DNA markers usually reveal low heterozygosity in small populations, whereas quantitative traits show reduced heritability only in the smallest and most inbred populations. Quantitative variation can even increase in bottlenecked populations although this effect seems unlikely to increase the adaptive potential of populations. Second, individuals in small populations have lower fitness owing to environmental stress and genetic problems such as inbreeding, which can substantially increase the extinction probability of populations in changing environments. This second reason has not been included in assessments of critical population size assuring evolvability and makes it likely that many small threatened populations have a decreased potential for adaptation.

   abstract = {Insect declines are being reported worldwide for flying, ground, and aquatic lineages. Most reports come from western and northern Europe, where the insect fauna is well-studied and there are considerable demographic data for many taxonomically disparate lineages. Additional cases of faunal losses have been noted from Asia, North America, the Arctic, the Neotropics, and elsewhere. While this review addresses both species loss and population declines, its emphasis is on the latter. Declines of abundant species can be especially worrisome, given that they anchor trophic interactions and shoulder many of the essential ecosystem services of their respective communities. A review of the factors believed to be responsible for observed collapses and those perceived to be especially threatening to insects form the core of this treatment. In addition to widely recognized threats to insect biodiversity, e.g., habitat destruction, agricultural intensification (including pesticide use), climate change, and invasive species, this assessment highlights a few less commonly considered factors such as atmospheric nitrification from the burning of fossil fuels and the effects of droughts and changing precipitation patterns. Because the geographic extent and magnitude of insect declines are largely unknown, there is an urgent need for monitoring efforts, especially across ecological gradients, which will help to identify important causal factors in declines. This review also considers the status of vertebrate insectivores, reporting bias, challenges inherent in collecting and interpreting insect demographic data, and cases of increasing insect abundance.},

   abstract = {Background: Climate oscillations in the Cenozoic reduced species richness and genetic diversity of terrestrial and aquatic animals and plants in central and northern Europe. The most abundant arthropods in temperate soils are Collembola that live in almost any soil-related habitat. Extant species show little morphological variation to Eocene fossils, suggesting persistence of species in stable habitats for millions of years. Collembola are able to evade adverse climatic conditions by moving into deeper soil layers and are tolerant to frost and draught. If these adaptations sufficed for surviving glacial periods remains open and needs to be investigated in a phylogeographic context, i.e. investigating spatial structure on molecular level. We investigated the molecular variation of three common species of Collembola at a pan-European scale to identify glacial refuges and post-glacial colonization patterns with three genetic markers. Results: All genes revealed remarkable genetic structure between but not within populations, suggesting density dependent processes for establishment of populations (founder-takes-all principle), which is common for European animals and plants. In contrast to the post-glacial recolonization patterns of many aboveground organisms, divergence times of most geographic lineages indicate preservation of genetic structure since the Miocene. Conclusions: Collembola survived severe climatic changes including those during Quatenary glaciation and kept high genetic variance across Europe. Likely the buffering of temperature oscilliations in soil and the ability to evade adverse climatic conditions due to cold-tolerance and horizontal migration enabled Collembola to evade strong selective pressure of abiotic forces.},

Here, we argue that multiple anthropogenic pressures - including land-use intensification, climate change, and the spread of alien species and diseases - are primarily responsible for insect-pollinator declines. We show that a complex interplay between pressures (eg lack of food sources, diseases, and pesticides) and biological processes (eg species dispersal and interactions) at a range of scales (from genes to ecosystems) underpins the general decline in insect-pollinator populations. Interdisciplinary research on the nature and impacts of these interactions will be needed if human food security and ecosystem function are to be preserved. We highlight key areas that require research focus and outline some practical steps to alleviate the pressures on pollinators and the pollination services they deliver to wild and crop plants. © The Ecological Society of America.},

An earlier approach, using allozymes, revealed extremely low variation among and within populations from NW Europe. Microsatellite marker analysis showed higher genetic variation than allozymes, and agreed with the previously reported low population differentiation in the species. Analysis of molecular variance showed that genetic variation within populations amounted to 96.5% of the total variation, whereas the remaining 3.5% is accounted for by population differentiation. Population differentiation, as described by microsatellite markers and with the exception of one population, can be explained by an isolation by distance.

This paper synthesizes current understanding of disturbance with an emphasis on fundamental contributions to contemporary landscape and ecosystem ecology, then identifies future research priorities. Studies of disturbance led to insights about heterogeneity, scale, and thresholds in space and time and catalyzed new paradigms in ecology. Because they create vegetation patterns, disturbances also establish spatial patterns of many ecosystem processes on the landscape. Drivers of global change will produce new spatial patterns, altered disturbance regimes, novel trajectories of change, and surprises. Future disturbances will continue to provide valuable opportunities for studying pattern-process interactions. Changing disturbance regimes will produce acute changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services over the short (years to decades) and long term (centuries and beyond). Future research should address questions related to (1) disturbances as catalysts of rapid ecological change, (2) interactions among disturbances, (3) relationships between disturbance and society, especially the intersection of land use and disturbance, and (4) feedbacks from disturbance to other global drivers. Ecologists should make a renewed and concerted effort to understand and anticipate the causes and consequences of changing disturbance regimes. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {1. Generalist arthropod predators act as natural enemies of insect pests in agroecosystems. Crop management activities may cause a reduction in arthropod densities, either directly through mortality and emigration, or indirectly through habitat disruption. Our aim was to quantify direct mortality caused by mechanical crop treatments. For some treatments, we also quantified emigration and other indirect effects, such as population declines caused by the impact of habitat deterioration on reproduction and survival. 2. Direct mortality was determined by measuring predator densities simultaneously in control and treatment plots using closed emergence traps immediately following a mechanical treatment. Treatments consisted of the following crop management activities: ploughing, non-inversion tillage, superficial soil loosening, mechanical weed control and grass cutting. Predator densities were measured a second time 5-26 days after treatment to quantify emigration and indirect effects. 3. All treatments had a negative influence on one or more arthropod taxa. Direct mortality caused a 25-60% reduction in arthropod densities. Overall, spiders were more vulnerable to mechanical crop treatment than carabid and staphylinid beetles. Intensive soil cultivation, such as ploughing and soil loosening, did not kill more arthropods than weed harrowing and grass cutting. 4. We estimated the cumulative effects of mortality, emigration and indirect effects 3 weeks following treatment. The cumulative effect was greater than direct arthropod mortality, suggesting delayed effects of habitat disruption. 5. Grass cutting caused spiders and staphylinid beetles to move out of the crop, except in one case when the grass was left to dry, suggesting an important role of organic material or structural elements for arthropod persistence. Our results also suggest that arthropod predators aggregate in undisturbed or less disrupted habitats. 6. Synthesis and applications. Mechanical operations in arable crops and grass cutting cause mortality and emigration of generalist arthropod predators, especially spiders. Effects can be species-specific and are likely to be affected by the timing of management. In grassland, cutting and removal have greater adverse impacts than leaving cuttings that contribute to habitat structure. Adjacent, less-disturbed refuge areas are colonized by predators following husbandry events, demonstrating significant spatial dynamics among farmland arthropods. The negative effects of crop husbandry operations might be mitigated by the provision of refuge areas within and adjacent to fields and by maintaining crop and landscape diversity.},

We explored the effects of large-scale habitat loss and fragmentation on spatial and temporal patterns of gene flow in a threatened Australian woodland bird: the Grey-crowned Babbler Pomatostomus temporalis. Using microsatellite data, we (1) investigated historical (i.e., pre-fragmentation) and contemporary (i.e., post-fragmentation) levels of gene flow among subpopulations and/or regions, (2) identified first-generation migrants and likely dispersal events, (3) tested for signatures of genetic bottlenecks, (4) estimated contemporary and historical effective population sizes, and (5) explored the relative influences of drift and migration in shaping contemporary population structure. Results indicated that the functional connectivity of landscapes used by the Grey-crowned Babbler is severely compromised in the study area. The proportion of individuals that were recent immigrants among all subpopulations were low. Habitat fragmentation has led to a clear division between subpopulations in the east and west, and the patterns of gene flow exchange between these two regions have changed over time. The effective population size estimates for these two regions are now well below that required for long-term population viability (Ne < 100). Demographic history models indicate that genetic drift was a greater influence on subpopulations than gene flow, and most subpopulations show signatures of bottlenecks. Translocations to promote gene flow and boost genetic diversity in the short term and targeted habitat restoration to improve landscape functional connectivity in the long term represent promising conservation management strategies that will likely have benefits for many other woodland bird species.},

We report a C. rubella reference genome sequence and compare RNA expression and polymorphism patterns between C. rubella and its outcrossing progenitor Capsella grandiflora. We found a clear shift in the expression of genes associated with flowering phenotypes, similar to that seen in Arabidopsis, in which self fertilization evolved about 1 million years ago. Comparisons of the two Capsella species showed evidence of rapid genome-wide relaxation of purifying selection in C. rubella without a concomitant change in transposable element abundance. Overall we document that the transition to selfing may be typified by parallel shifts in gene expression, along with a measurable reduction of purifying selection. © 2013 Nature America, Inc.

   abstract = {Recent reports of local extinctions of arthropod species1, and of massive declines in arthropod biomass2, point to land-use intensification as a major driver of decreasing biodiversity. However, to our knowledge, there are no multisite time series of arthropod occurrences across gradients of land-use intensity with which to confirm causal relationships. Moreover, it remains unclear which land-use types and arthropod groups are affected, and whether the observed declines in biomass and diversity are linked to one another. Here we analyse data from more than 1 million individual arthropods (about 2,700 species), from standardized inventories taken between 2008 and 2017 at 150 grassland and 140 forest sites in 3 regions of Germany. Overall gamma diversity in grasslands and forests decreased over time, indicating loss of species across sites and regions. In annually sampled grasslands, biomass, abundance and number of species declined by 67%, 78% and 34%, respectively. The decline was consistent across trophic levels and mainly affected rare species; its magnitude was independent of local land-use intensity. However, sites embedded in landscapes with a higher cover of agricultural land showed a stronger temporal decline. In 30 forest sites with annual inventories, biomass and species number—but not abundance—decreased by 41% and 36%, respectively. This was supported by analyses of all forest sites sampled in three-year intervals. The decline affected rare and abundant species, and trends differed across trophic levels. Our results show that there are widespread declines in arthropod biomass, abundance and the number of species across trophic levels. Arthropod declines in forests demonstrate that loss is not restricted to open habitats. Our results suggest that major drivers of arthropod decline act at larger spatial scales, and are (at least for grasslands) associated with agriculture at the landscape level. This implies that policies need to address the landscape scale to mitigate the negative effects of land-use practices.},

   abstract = {The vast majority of the energy and nutrients that is obtained by plants eventually becomes incorporated in dead organic matter or detritus (78, 108). Both the disappearance of this material (i.e. decomposition) and the release of the inorganic elements that are bound in detritus (i.e. mineralization) are critical to the continued productivity of terrestrial ecosystems (95). The accu­ mulation of dead organic matter not only locks away plant nutrients, but in certain ecosystems it reduces the amount of energy available for plant metabo­ lism and photosynthesis because of the insulating and shading effects of litter (41, 66). As a result, terrestrial decomposition and mineralization processes have been the subject of a considerable scientific effort by biochemists, soil scientists, bacteriologists, mycologists, invertebrate zoologists, and ecolo­ gists. A massive literature on this subject is available, and two extensive reviews have been published in the last decade (27, 93). The concept that soil fauna regulates the decomposition process has become increasingly popular (7, 22, 23, 117) in spite of the fact that the amount of soil metabolism (C02 production) that can be attributed to all soil animals is 10% or less of the total amount (12, 71, 72, 77). Fungi and bacteria are directly responsible for most of the organic matter breakdown, but a diverse assemblage of protozoans, nematodes, annelids, and arthropods greatly influence the functioning of the decomposer flora as a direct and indirect result of their feeding activities. This review examines the importance of one component of the soil fauna, the microarthropods, in decomposition and mineralization processes.},

This pivotal concept of population genetics has implications for species health, domestication, management and conservation. Levels of genetic diversity seem to vary greatly in natural populations and species, but the determinants of this variation, and particularly the relative influences of species biology and ecology versus population history, are still largely mysterious. Here we show that the diversity of a species is predictable, and is determined in the first place by its ecological strategy. We investigated the genome-wide diversity of 76 non-model animal species by sequencing the transcriptome of two to ten individuals in each species. The distribution of genetic diversity between species revealed no detectable influence of geographic range or invasive status but was accurately predicted by key species traits related to parental investment: long-lived or low-fecundity species with brooding ability were genetically less diverse than short-lived or highly fecund ones. Our analysis demonstrates the influence of long-term life-history strategies on species response to short-term environmental perturbations, a result with immediate implications for conservation policies.},

Few molecular studies have been conducted on S. viridis and none have examined its population genetics, despite the importance for developing effective control strategies. Here, we characterize the genetic structure of Australian populations using three allozyme and eight microsatellite loci, as well as sequencing a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I gene. We found that S. viridis in Australia are diploid, sexually reproducing and exhibit significant population structure as a result of limited gene flow. Despite significant differentiation between populations, there was very low cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequence variation, indicating the presence of a single species in Australia. The observed structure only marginally complied with an 'isolation by distance' model with human-mediated long-distance dispersal likely occurring. Allozymes and microsatellites gave very similar FST estimates, although differences found for novel alternative estimates of differentiation suggest that the allozymes did not capture the full extent of the population structure. These results highlight that control strategies may need to vary for locally adapted S. viridis populations and strategies aimed at limiting the spread of any future pesticide resistance will need to manage the effects of human-mediated dispersal.},

To facilitate overcoming these debates, here we: (i) review the state of the literature on habitat fragmentation, finding widespread confusion and stigma; (ii) identify consequences of this for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management; and (iii) suggest ways in which research can move forward to resolve these problems. Confusion is evident from the 25 most-cited fragmentation articles published between 2017 and 2021. These articles use five distinct concepts of habitat fragmentation, only one of which clearly distinguishes habitat fragmentation from habitat area and other factors (‘fragmentation per se’). Stigmatization is evident from our new findings that fragmentation papers are more charged with negative sentiments when compared to papers from other subfields in the environmental sciences, and that fragmentation papers with more negative sentiments are cited more. While most empirical studies of habitat fragmentation per se find neutral or positive effects on species and biodiversity outcomes, which implies that small habitat patches have a high cumulative value, confusion and stigma in reporting and discussing such results have led to suboptimal habitat protection policy. For example, government agencies, conservation organizations, and land trusts impose minimum habitat patch sizes on habitat protection. Given the high cumulative value of small patches, such policies mean that many opportunities for conservation are being missed. Our review highlights the importance of reducing confusion and stigma in habitat fragmentation research. To this end, we propose implementing study designs in which multiple sample landscapes are selected across independent gradients of habitat amount and fragmentation, measured as patch density. We show that such designs are possible for forest habitat across Earth's biomes. As such study designs are adopted, and as language becomes more precise, we expect that confusion and stigma in habitat fragmentation research will dissipate. We also expect important breakthroughs in understanding the situations where effects of habitat fragmentation per se are neutral, positive, or negative, and the reasons for these differences. Ultimately this will improve efficacy of area-based conservation policies, to the benefit of biodiversity and people.},

   abstract = {Soil life supports the functioning and biodiversity of terrestrial ecosystems. Springtails (Collembola) are among the most abundant soil arthropods regulating soil fertility and flow of energy through above- and belowground food webs. However, the global distribution of springtail diversity and density, and how these relate to energy fluxes remains unknown. Here, using a global dataset representing 2470 sites, we estimate the total soil springtail biomass at 27.5 megatons carbon, which is threefold higher than wild terrestrial vertebrates, and record peak densities up to 2 million individuals per square meter in the tundra. Despite a 20-fold biomass difference between the tundra and the tropics, springtail energy use (community metabolism) remains similar across the latitudinal gradient, owing to the changes in temperature with latitude. Neither springtail density nor community metabolism is predicted by local species richness, which is high in the tropics, but comparably high in some temperate forests and even tundra. Changes in springtail activity may emerge from latitudinal gradients in temperature, predation and resource limitation in soil communities. Contrasting relationships of biomass, diversity and activity of springtail communities with temperature suggest that climate warming will alter fundamental soil biodiversity metrics in different directions, potentially restructuring terrestrial food webs and affecting soil functioning.},

   abstract = {The relationship between population size, inbreeding, loss of genetic variation and evolutionary potential of fitness traits is still unresolved, and large-scale empirical studies testing theoretical expectations are surprisingly scarce. Here we present a highly replicated experimental evolution setup with 120 lines of Drosophila melanogaster having experienced inbreeding caused by low population size for a variable number of generations. Genetic variation in inbred lines and in outbred control lines was assessed by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) of pooled samples consisting of 15 males per line. All lines were reared on a novel stressful medium for 10 generations during which body mass, productivity, and extinctions were scored in each generation. In addition, we investigated egg-to-adult viability in the benign and the stressful environments before and after rearing at the stressful conditions for 10 generations. We found strong positive correlations between levels of genetic variation and evolutionary response in all investigated traits, and showed that genomic variation was more informative in predicting evolutionary responses than population history reflected by expected inbreeding levels. We also found that lines with lower genetic diversity were at greater risk of extinction. For viability, the results suggested a trade-off in the costs of adapting to the stressful environments when tested in a benign environment. This work presents convincing support for long-standing evolutionary theory, and it provides novel insights into the association between genetic variation and evolutionary capacity in a gradient of diversity rather than dichotomous inbred/outbred groups.},

   abstract = {Since the introduction of agriculture, 4000 BC, the Danish region has witnessed a change from almost complete woodland cover to the landscapes present at AD 1800 that were dominated by heathland, cultivated areas, grassland or patchy woodland. We used a combination of pollen records and landscape data to identify the timing and major pathways of this land-cover transformation. 2 Pollen assemblages dated to about AD 1800 were collected from 20 Danish lakes with a median size of 26 ha. Fossil pollen records for the interval 4500 BC - AD 1800 were compiled from 11 of these 20 sites and divided into 11 time units corresponding to major archaeological periods. 3 Land cover around the 20 sites was digitized from historical maps, dating from the same period as the pollen assemblages. Percentage cover of woodland, heathland, wetland and agricultural land within 2- and 5-km radii were calculated (calculations were also made within 10- and 20-km radii for woodland). Environmental data within 5 km of each site were collected from soil, geological and topographical maps. 4 The AD 1800 pollen assemblages formed three clusters characterized by either a dominance (> 20%) of Calluna (group A), a dominance (> 10%) of Fagus (group B) and a dominance of Poaceae with Fagus < 10% and Calluna < 20% (group C). Respectively, these clusters correspond well to sites where heathland is the dominant land cover, where it has a strong woodland element and where agricultural land is dominant with little, if any, woodland or heathland. 5 Direct and indirect ordinations suggest that the main variation in the pollen assemblages from the 20 sites is related to gradients in soil clay content and in the degree of landscape openness. Land-cover data from within a 2-km radius account for almost as much of the variation in pollen data as do land-cover data from within a 5-km radius. 6 Indirect ordinations of AD 1800 samples with the fossil records as passive samples reveal that long-term records from cluster B sites (the '1800 woodland type') show little landscape variation through time. Samples from cluster C sites (the '1800 agricultural area type') show the same starting point as cluster B but their development diverge to more open landscapes. Cluster A sites (the '1800 heathland type') either develop directly from rather wooded landscapes to heathland or by heathland expansion after initial development towards landscapes producing cluster C type pollen assemblages. 7 Chord distances between the AD 1800 sample and the (pre)historic samples at 10 long-term sites strongly suggest that the between-site variation in land-cover characteristic of the early 19th century was already in existence by 1000 BC. Direct ordination of the fossil samples using woodland cover at AD 1800 as an environmental variable and soil clay content as a covariable also indicates that the macro-scale land-cover patterns of the historical cultural landscape in Denmark has been present for more than 3000 years.},

The test is based on the expectation that after millions of years without these processes, genomes will no longer contain pairs of closely similar haplotypes and instead will contain highly divergent descendants of formerly allelic nucleotide sequences. We find that genomes of individual bdelloid rotifers, representing four different species, appear to lack pairs of closely similar sequences and contain representatives of two ancient lineages that began to diverge before the bdelloid radiation many millions of years ago when sexual reproduction and genetic exchange may have ceased.},

   abstract = {Although extensive work has been done on the relationship between population size and the risk of extinction due to demographic and environmental stochasticity, the role of genetic deterioration in the extinction process is poorly understood. We develop a general theoretical approach for evaluating the risk of small populations to extinction via the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations, and we support this with extensive computer simulations. Unlike previous attempts to model the genetic consequences of small population size, our approach is genetically explicit and fully accounts for the mutations inherited by a founder population as well as those introduced by subsequent mutation. Application of empirical estimates of the properties of spontaneous deleterious mutations leads to the conclusion that populations with effective sizes smaller than 100 (and actual sizes smaller than 1,000) are highly vulnerable to extinction via a mutational meltdown on timescales of approximately 100 generations. We point out a number of reasons why this is likely to be an overly optimistic view. Thus, from a purely genetic perspective, current management policies that provide formal protection to species only after they have dwindled to 100-1,000 individuals are inadequate. A doubling of the deleterious mutation rate, as can result from the release of mutagenic pollutants by human activity, is expected to reduce the longevity of a population by about 50%. As some investigators have previously suggested, the genetic load of a population can be readily purged by intentional inbreeding. However, this effect is at best transient, as intentional inbreeding can only enhance the probability of fixation of deleterious alleles, and those alleles that are purged are rapidly replaced with new mutations.},

   abstract = {Finding new protein-coding genes is one of the most important goals of eukaryotic genome sequencing projects. However, genomic organization of novel eukaryotic genomes is diverse and ab initio gene finding tools tuned up for previously studied species are rarely suitable for efficacious gene hunting in DNA sequences of a new genome. Gene identification methods based on cDNA and expressed sequence tag (EST) mapping to genomic DNA or those using alignments to closely related genomes rely either on existence of abundant cDNA and EST data and/ or availability on reference genomes. Conventional statistical ab initio methods require large training sets of validated genes for estimating gene model parameters. In practice, neither one of these types of data may be available in sufficient amount until rather late stages of the novel genome sequencing. Nevertheless, we have shown that gene finding in eukaryotic genomes could be carried out in parallel with statistical models estimation directly from yet anonymous genomic DNA. The suggested method of parallelization of gene prediction with the model parameters estimation follows the path of the iterative Viterbi training. Rounds of genomic sequence labeling into coding and non-coding regions are followed by the rounds of model parameters estimation. Several dynamically changing restrictions on the possible range of model parameters are added to filter out fluctuations in the initial steps of the algorithm that could redirect the iteration process away from the biologically relevant point in parameter space. Tests on well-studied eukaryotic genomes have shown that the new method performs comparably or better than conventional methods where the supervised model training precedes the gene prediction step. Several novel genomes have been analyzed and biologically interesting findings are discussed. Thus, a self-training algorithm that had been assumed feasible only for prokaryotic genomes has now been developed for ab initio eukaryotic gene identification. © The Author 2005.

Our research uncovers critical shifts in cropland, grazing land, and livestock density offering unprecedented insights into the mechanisms driving agricultural expansion and intensification. The mechanisms driving this expansion and their potential impact on contemporary agroecological challenges linked to land use intensification are explored. Our results point to a significant broadening and shifting of land use frontiers offering a historical perspective on agricultural land use.

   abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (Drosophila: 2.8× 10-9 per bp per haploid genome per generation; Heliconius: 2.9× 10-9) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4× 10-9). Might the honeybee's rate be 20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenicff To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6× 10-9 per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38× 10-9 and 5.37× 10-9) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.},

   abstract = {In natural populations, it is expected that there is a constant supply of mutations in each generation. These mutations may have different persistence depending on their fitnesses, but collectively, they constitute the ultimate source
of genetic variability in the populations. Since the maintenance of genetic variability is an important subject of study in population genetics, it may be worthwhile to investigate, using various models, the effect of mutation on the genetic variability. For example, KIMURA and CROW (1964) studied the number of alleles maintained in a finite population, assuming that each mutant is an allele not preexisting in the population. In the present paper I will use a different model and will investigate the num-
ber of heterozygous sites per individual and some related quantities that represent the statistical properties of the mutant frequency distribution, assuming that a very large number of independent sites are available for mutation. In this paper,
“site” refers to a single nucleotide pair, although the theory is still appropriate to a small group of nucleotides, such as a codon.},

We detected nine new mutations, each one affecting a single site in a single offspring. This yields an estimated mutation rate of 2.9 × 10-9 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 × 10-9-5.5 × 10-9), which is similar to recent estimates in Drosophila melanogaster, the only other insect species in which the mutation rate has been directly estimated. We infer that recent effective population size of H. melpomene is about 2 million, a substantially lower value than its census size, suggesting a role for natural selection reducing diversity. We estimate that H. melpomene diverged from its Müllerian comimic H. erato about 6 Ma, a somewhat later date than estimates based on a local molecular clock.},

Whereas previous knowledge has been limited in scope and rigor, here we statistically synthesize empirical comparisons of recent driver impacts found through a wide-ranging review. We show that land/sea use change has been the dominant direct driver of recent biodiversity loss worldwide. Direct exploitation of natural resources ranks second and pollution third; climate change and invasive alien species have been significantly less important than the top two drivers. The oceans, where direct exploitation and climate change dominate, have a different driver hierarchy from land and fresh water. It also varies among types of biodiversity indicators. For example, climate change is a more important driver of community composition change than of changes in species populations. Stopping global biodiversity loss requires policies and actions to tackle all the major drivers and their interactions, not some of them in isolation.},

In 1999, emergence from winter-ploughed or undisturbed plots in fields of wheat stubble or undersown grass leys was compared, with and without frost protection. The catch was dominated by adult and larval Coleoptera, of which 68 and 77 % were Carabidae in 1998 and 1999 respectively. In 1998 the period of peak emergence of Carabidae, Cur-culionidae and total Coleoptera were earlier from unploughed compared to ploughed treatments. None of the treatments influenced the time of arthropod emergence in 1999. In 1998 only Curculionidae were affected by ploughing, with more being captured from the winter-ploughed plots. In 1999 the emergence of six carabid species was lower from the ploughed plots, whereas Notiophilus biguttatus (Coleoptera: Carabidae) favoured the ploughed plots. Total Carabidae, other coleopteran adults and larvae and aranean groups were also lower in the ploughed plots.

   abstract = {Conservation tillage (CT) is practised on 45 million ha world-wide, predominantly in North and South America but its uptake is also increasing in South Africa, Australia and other semi-arid areas of the world. It is primarily used as a means to protect soils from erosion and compaction, to conserve moisture and reduce production costs. In Europe, the area cultivated using minimum tillage is increasing primarily in an effort to reduce production costs, but also as a way of preventing soil erosion and retain soil moisture. A large proportion (16%) of Europe's cultivated land is also prone to soil degradation but farmers and governments are being slow to recognise and address the problem, despite the widespread environmental problems that can occur when soils become degraded. Conservation tillage can improve soil structure and stability thereby facilitating better drainage and water holding capacity that reduces the extremes of water logging and drought. These improvements to soil structure also reduce the risk of runoff and pollution of surface waters with sediment, pesticides and nutrients. Reducing the intensity of soil cultivation lowers energy consumption and the emission of carbon dioxide, while carbon sequestration is raised though the increase in soil organic matter (SOM). Under conservation tillage, a richer soil biota develops that can improve nutrient recycling and this may also help combat crop pests and diseases. The greater availability of crop residues and weed seeds improves food supplies for insects, birds and small mammals. All these aspects are reviewed but detailed information on the environmental benefits of conservation tillage is sparse and disparate from European studies. No detailed studies have been conducted at the catchment scale in Europe, therefore some findings must be treated with caution until they can be verified at a larger scale and for a greater range of climatic, cropping and soil conditions. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Conservation research is dominated by vertebrate examples but the shorter generation times and high local population sizes of invertebrates may lead to very different management strategies, particularly for species with low movement rates. Here we investigate the genetic structure of an endangered flightless grasshopper, Keyacris scurra, which was used in classical evolutionary studies in the 1960s. It had a wide distribution across New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria in pre-European times but has now become threatened because of land clearing for agriculture and other activities. We revisited remnant sites of K. scurra, with populations now restricted to only one area in Victoria and a few small patches in NSW and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Using DArtseq to generate SNP markers as well as mtDNA sequence data, we show that the remaining Victorian populations in an isolated valley are genetically distinct from the NSW populations and that all populations tend to be genetically unique, with large FST values up to 0.8 being detected for the SNP datasets. We also find that, with one notable exception, the NSW/ACT populations separate genetically into previously described chromosomal races (2n = 15 vs. 2n = 17). Isolation by distance was detected across both the SNP and mtDNA datasets, and there was substantial differentiation within chromosomal races. Genetic diversity as measured by heterozygosity was not correlated with the size of remaining habitat where the populations were found, with high variation present in some remnant cemetery sites. However, inbreeding correlated negatively with estimated habitat size at 25–500 m patch radius. These findings emphasize the importance of small habitat areas in conserving genetic variation in such species with low mobility, and they highlight populations suitable for future translocation efforts.},

From the protein-coding genes predicted by GeneMark-ES/ET, we select a set for training AUGUSTUS, one of the most accurate gene finding tools that, in contrast to GeneMark-ES/ET, integrates extrinsic evidence already into the gene prediction step. The first published version, BRAKER1, integrated genomic footprints of unassembled RNA-Seq reads into the training as well as into the prediction steps. The pipeline has since been extended to the integration of data on mapped cross-species proteins, and to the usage of heterogeneous extrinsic evidence, both RNA-Seq and protein alignments.

Many organisms are facultative sexuals, with the ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually. Reduced sequencing costs means it is now possible to start investigating genome sequences of a wider number of these organisms in depth, but teasing apart the genetic forces underlying the maintenance of facultative sexual reproduction remains a challenge. An analogous problem exists when determining the genetic consequences of a degree of outcrossing (and recombination) in otherwise self-fertilizing organisms. Here, I provide an overview of existing research on the evolutionary basis behind different reproductive modes, with a focus on explaining the population genetic effects favouring low outcrossing rates in either partially selfing or asexual species. I review the outcomes that both self-fertilization and asexuality have on either purging deleterious mutations or fixing beneficial alleles, and what empirical data exist to support these theories. In particular, a greater application of mathematical models to genomic data has provided insight into the numerous effects that transitions to self-fertilization from outcrossing have on genetic architecture. Similar modelling approaches could be used to determine the forces shaping genetic diversity of facultative sexual species. Hence, a further unification of mathematical models with next-generation sequence data will prove important in exploring the genetic influences on reproductive system evolution.},

Spatial autocorrelation statistics are often used for this purpose, but their relationships with population genetics models have not been thoroughly established. Moreover, it has been argued that the dependency of these statistics on variation in mutation rates among loci strongly limits their interest for inferential purposes. In the context of an isolation by distance process, we describe relationships between a descriptor of the spatial genetic structure used in empirical studies, Moran's I statistic and population genetics parameters. In particular, we point out that, when Moran's I statistic is used to describe correlation in allele frequencies at the individual level, it provides an estimator of Wright's coefficient of relationship. We also show that the latter parameter, as a descriptor of genetic structure, is not influenced by selfing rate or ploidy level. Under specific finite population models, numerical simulations show that values of Moran's I statistic can be predicted from analytical theory. These simulations are also used to estimate the time taken to approach a structure at equilibrium. Finally, we discuss the conditions under which spatial autocorrelation statistics are little influenced by variation in mutation rates, so that they could be used to estimate gene dispersal parameters.},

   abstract = {Migration is essential for maintaining genetic diversity among populations, and pumas (Puma concolor) provide an excellent model for studying the genetic impacts of migrants on populations isolated by increasing human development. In densely populated southern California, USA, puma populations on the east and west side of interstate highway 15 (I-15) have become fragmented into a small inbred population on the west side (Santa Ana Mountains) and a relatively larger, more diverse population on the east side (Eastern Peninsular Range). From 146 sampled pumas, genetic analyses indicate seven pumas crossed I-15 over the last 15 years, including four males from west to east, and three males from east to west. However, only a single migrant (named M86) was detected to have produced offspring and contribute to gene flow across the I-15 barrier. Prior to the M86 migration, the Santa Ana population exhibited inbreeding and had significantly lower genetic diversity than the Eastern Peninsular Range population. After M86 emigrated, he sired 11 offspring with Santa Ana females, decreasing inbreeding measures and raising heterozygosity to levels similar to pumas in the Eastern Peninsular Range. The emigration of M86 also introduced new alleles into the Santa Ana population, although allelic richness still remained significantly lower than the Eastern Peninsular population. Our results clearly show the benefit of a single migrant to the genetics of a small, isolated population. However, ongoing development and habitat loss on both sides of I-15 will increasingly strengthen the barrier to successful migration. Furthermonitoring, and potential human intervention, including minimizing development effects on connectivity, adding or improving freeway crossing structures, or animal translocation, may be needed to ensure adequate gene flow and long-term persistence of the Santa Ana puma population.},

In the centuries that followed, the share of global cropland increased to 2% in ad 1700 (c. 3 million km2) and 11% in ad 2000 (15 million km2), while the share of pasture area grew from 2% in ad 1700 to 24% in ad 2000 (34 million km2) These profound land-use changes have had, and will continue to have, quite considerable consequences for global biogeochemical cycles, and subsequently global climate change.Main conclusions Some researchers suggest that humans have shifted from living in the Holocene (emergence of agriculture) into the Anthropocene (humans capable of changing the Earth's atmosphere) since the start of the Industrial Revolution. But in the light of the sheer size and magnitude of some historical land-use changes (e.g. as result of the depopulation of Europe due to the Black Death in the 14th century and the aftermath of the colonization of the Americas in the 16th century) we believe that this point might have occurred earlier in time. While there are still many uncertainties and gaps in our knowledge about the importance of land use (change) in the global biogeochemical cycle, we hope that this database can help global (climate) change modellers to close parts of this gap. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Balancing selection can maintain immunogenetic variation within host populations, but detecting its signal in a postbottlenecked population is challenging due to the potentially overriding effects of drift. Toll-like receptor genes (TLRs) play a fundamental role in vertebrate immune defence and are predicted to be under balancing selection. We previously characterized variation at TLR loci in the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis), an endemic passerine that has undergone a historical bottleneck. Five of seven TLR loci were polymorphic, which is in sharp contrast to the low genomewide variation observed. However, standard population genetic statistical methods failed to detect a contemporary signature of selection at any TLR locus. We examined whether the observed TLR polymorphism could be explained by neutral evolution, simulating the population's demography in the software DIYABC. This showed that the posterior distributions of mutation rates had to be unrealistically high to explain the observed genetic variation. We then conducted simulations with an agent-based model using typical values for the mutation rate, which indicated that weak balancing selection has acted on the three TLR genes. The model was able to detect evidence of past selection elevating TLR polymorphism in the prebottleneck populations, but was unable to discern any effects of balancing selection in the contemporary population. Our results show drift is the overriding evolutionary force that has shaped TLR variation in the contemporary Seychelles warbler population, and the observed TLR polymorphisms might be merely the ‘ghost of selection past’. Forecast models predict immunogenetic variation in this species will continue to be eroded in the absence of contemporary balancing selection. Such ‘drift debt’ occurs when a gene pool has not yet reached its new equilibrium level of polymorphism, and this loss could be an important threat to many recently bottlenecked populations.},

As part of a comparative research program, the phylogeography of a new, endemic Australian genus and species of log-dependent (saproxylic) collembola was investigated using mitochondrial sequences, allozymes and anonymous single-copy nuclear markers. We found the genetic structure of the species corresponds with five a priori microbiogeographical regions, with population subdivision at various depths owing to palaeoclimatic influences. Closely related mtDNA haplotypes are co-distributed within a single region or occur in adjacent regions, nuclear allele frequencies are more similar among more proximate populations, and interpopulation migration is rare. Based on mtDNA divergence, a late Miocene-late Pliocene coalescence is likely. The present-day distribution of genetic diversity seems to have been impacted by three major climatic events: Pliocene cooling and drying (2.5-7 million years before present, Mybp), early Pleistocene wet-dry oscillations (c. 1.2 Mybp) and the more recent glacial-interglacial cycles that have characterized the latter part of the Quaternary (< 0.4 Mybp).},

Loss of genetic diversity, however, can affect population persistence, evolutionary potential, and individual fitness. Although mammals are a well-studied taxonomic group, a comprehensive assessment of mammalian genetic diversity based on modern molecular markers is lacking. We examined published microsatellite data from populations of 108 mammalian species to evaluate background patterns of genetic variability across taxa and body masses. We tested for loss of genetic diversity at the population level by asking whether populations that experienced demographic threats exhibited lower levels of genetic diversity. We also evaluated the effect of ascertainment bias (a reduction in variability when microsatellite primers are transferred across species) on our assessment of genetic diversity. Heterozygosity did not vary with body mass across species ranging in size from shrews to whales. Differences across taxonomic groupings were noted at the highest level, between populations of marsupial and placental mammals. We documented consistently lower heterozygosity, however, in populations that had experienced demographic threats across a wide range of mammalian species. We also documented a significant (p = 0.01) reduction in heterozygosity as a result of ascertainment bias. Our results suggest that populations of both rare and common mammals are currently losing genetic diversity and that conservation efforts focused above the population level may fail to protect the breadth of persisting genetic diversity.

   abstract = {The role of genetic factors in extinction has been a controversial issue, especially since Lande's paper [Genetics and demography in biological conservation, Science 241 (1988) 1455-1460] paper in Science. Here I review the evidence on the contribution of genetic factors to extinction risk. Inbreeding depression, loss of genetic diversity and mutation accumulation have been hypothesised to increase extinction risk. There is now compelling evidence that inbreeding depression and loss of genetic diversity increase extinction risk in laboratory populations of naturally outbreeding species. There is now clear evidence for inbreeding depression in wild species of naturally outbreeding species and strong grounds from individual case studies and from computer projections for believing that this contributes to extinction risk. Further, most species are not driven to extinction before genetic factors have time to impact. The contributions of mutation accumulation to extinction risk in threatened taxa appear to be small and to require very many generations. Thus, there is now sufficient evidence to regard the controversies regarding the contribution of genetic factors to extinction risk as resolved. If genetic factors are ignored, extinction risk will be underestimated and inappropriate recovery strategies may be used. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Counts of several Collembola species in a rotation of grass and wheat cropping were consistently lower under a conventional regime of pesticide use than under a reduced-input regime. During a six-year period (1991–1996), counts of Entomobrya nicoleti remained at or close to zero under the conventional regime. This raised the question of how long recovery would take if conventional pesticide inputs ceased. To answer this question, and confirm effects of the pesticide regimes on patchily distributed species, the two pesticide regimes were reversed spatially: from 1997 to 1999 the area formerly under conventional inputs subsequently received the reduced-input regime and vice versa. This paper presents results up to summer 1998 to show the effect on collembolan counts of reversing the pesticide regimes. Responses varied among species: after conversion of the conventional regime to reduced inputs, counts of E. nicoleti remained at or close to zero whereas counts of Isotoma viridis were the highest recorded during the study. Data from a rotation of cereals and break crops show that reversal of treatments can aid interpretation of pesticide effects for species with a patchy temporal distribution; treatment reversal improved confidence in the interpretation of pesticide effects for species of Collembola which were not present during the pre-treatment sampling phase of a long-term study.},

Delayed biotic responses to land-use change impede the establishment of causal links between specific anthropogenic changes and resulting biodiversity change. Therefore, we aimed at investigating changes to plant species pools: (a) at time scales long enough to encompass past land-use changes, even changes that have ceased from collective memory; and (b) at spatial scales wide enough to encompass landscape-wide changes to habitat quantity and quality. Location: Denmark, 10 regions in the range 54°3′–56°7′ N and 10°4′–12°4′ E. Methods: We assessed changes to regional plant species pools over ca 140 years by comparing high-quality legacy data to recent re-surveys in ten Danish regions. To identify anthropogenic drivers of plant compositional change, we assessed ecological properties of winning and losing plant species and compared observed biotic changes to land-cover data spatially and temporally matching the regional flora data. Results: Winner species were strongly associated with shaded, fertile, well-drained conditions. Loser species were associated with open, infertile conditions with either moist or xeric soils. The major land-use changes driving biotic change were: (a) drainage of moist and wet biotopes; (b) active afforestation and passive scrub overgrowth due to ceased grazing; and (c) landscape-wide increased nutrient availability. However, the magnitude of increase or decrease in the area of a land-cover type was a poor predictor of the number of habitat-associated winner or loser species. This suggests that degradation of extant biotopes and/or low quality of new biotopes limits plant species richness, in particular of habitat specialists. Conclusions: We demonstrate a displacement of plant ecospace towards mesic, shaded and fertile conditions, with profound effects on plant diversity, and mainly driven by intensified agricultural/silvicultural use of the landscape matrix, which has strongly affected the main plant habitats in scattered semi-natural fragments.},

We show that our composite-likelihood approach allows one to study evolutionary models of arbitrary complexity, which cannot be tackled by other current likelihood-based methods. For simple scenarios, our approach compares favorably in terms of accuracy and speed with ∂a∂i, the current reference in the field, while showing better convergence properties for complex models. We first apply our methodology to non-coding genomic SNP data from four human populations. To infer their demographic history, we compare neutral evolutionary models of increasing complexity, including unsampled populations. We further show the versatility of our framework by extending it to the inference of demographic parameters from SNP chips with known ascertainment, such as that recently released by Affymetrix to study human origins. Whereas previous ways of handling ascertained SNPs were either restricted to a single population or only allowed the inference of divergence time between a pair of populations, our framework can correctly infer parameters of more complex models including the divergence of several populations, bottlenecks and migration. We apply this approach to the reconstruction of African demography using two distinct ascertained human SNP panels studied under two evolutionary models. The two SNP panels lead to globally very similar estimates and confidence intervals, and suggest an ancient divergence (>110 Ky) between Yoruba and San populations. Our methodology appears well suited to the study of complex scenarios from large genomic data sets. © 2013 Excoffier et al.},

   abstract = {Population bottlenecks occur frequently in threatened species and result in loss of genetic diversity and evolutionary potential. These may range in severity between short intense bottlenecks, and more diffuse bottlenecks over many generations. However, there is little information on the impacts of different types of bottlenecks and disagreement as to their likely impacts. To resolve this issue, we subjected replicate Drosophila populations to intense bottlenecks , consisting of one pair over a single generation, versus diffuse bottlenecks consisting of an effective size of 100 over 57 generations. The intense and diffuse bottlenecks were designed to induce identical losses of hetero-zygosity. However, computer simulations showed that the probability of retaining alleles is lower in the intense than the diffuse bottleneck treatment. The effects of these bottlenecks on genetic diversity at nine microsatellite loci in Drosophila were evaluated. Bottlenecks substantially reduced allelic diversity, heterozygosity and proportion of loci polymorphic, changed allele frequency distributions and resulted in large differences among replicate populations. Allelic diversity, scaled by heterozygosity, was lower in the intense than the diffuse treatments. Short-term evolutionary potential, measured as the ability of bottlenecked populations to cope with increasing concentrations of NaCl, did not differ between the intense and diffuse bottlenecked populations. The effects of bottlenecks on short-term evolutionary potential relate to loss of heterozygosity, rather than allelic diversity.},

The determinants of this variation have been poorly understood, but population genomic data from a wide range of organisms now make it possible to delineate the underlying evolutionary processes, notably how variation in the effective population size (N e) governs genetic diversity. Comparative population genomics is on its way to providing a solution to 'Lewontin's paradox'-the discrepancy between the many orders of magnitude of variation in population size and the much narrower distribution of diversity levels. It seems that linked selection plays an important part both in the overall genetic diversity of a species and in the variation in diversity within the genome.

   abstract = {Between 1990 and 2000, farmland birds showed a significant decline across Europe, a trend not shared by bird assemblages of other habitats over the same period. Mean trends for each farmland species in the period 1990-2000 were positively correlated with trends over the period 1970-1990, and there was little change in population trajectory for most species over the 30-year period. Of the 58 species classed by an independent assessment as being primarily birds of farmland, 41 showed negative overall mean trends across Europe in 1990-2000, 19 of them significant. There was a significant negative correlation between mean national trends of all farmland species and indices of national agricultural intensity. This relationship strengthened when the 19 declining species were considered alone, and was not apparent when only non-declining species were considered. Population trends of terrestrial non-farmland bird species over the same period were unrelated to agricultural intensity. Trends in farmland bird populations were independent of the proportion of farmland under agri-environment prescriptions. The results support earlier evidence that population trends of farmland birds across Europe can be predicted from gross national agricultural statistics. Substantial changes in agricultural policy, particularly the removal of economic incentives that lead to agricultural intensification, are required if 2010 targets for halting loss of biodiversity are to be met in an enlarged European Union. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the largest threats to amphibian populations. However, most studies have not provided clear insights into their population-level implications. There is a critical need to investigate the mechanisms that underlie patterns of distribution and abundance. In order to understand the population- and species-level implications of habitat loss and fragmentation, it is necessary to move from site-specific inferences to assessments of how the influences of multiple factors interact across extensive landscapes to influence population size and population connectivity. The goal of this paper is to summarize the state of knowledge, identify information gaps and suggest research approaches to provide reliable knowledge and effective conservation of amphibians in landscapes experiencing habitat loss and fragmentation. Reliable inferences require attention to species-specific ecological characteristics and their interactions with environmental conditions at a range of spatial scales. Habitat connectivity appears to play a key role in regional viability of amphibian populations. In amphibians, population connectivity is predominantly effected through juvenile dispersal. The preponderance of evidence suggests that the short-term impact of habitat loss and fragmentation increases with dispersal ability. However, species with limited dispersal abilities are likely to be equally imperiled by habitat loss and fragmentation over longer time periods. Rigorous understanding of the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on amphibians will require species-specific, multi-scale, mechanistic investigations, and will be benefit from integrating large empirical field studies with molecular genetics and simulation modeling. Molecular genetic methods are particularly suited to quantifying the influences of habitat structure across large spatial extents on gene flow and population connectivity. Conservation strategies would benefit by moving from generalizations to species and process specific recommendations and by moving from site-specific actions to implementing conservation plans at multiple scales across broad landscapes. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We assembled individual mitochondrial cyto-chrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) sequences (n = 866) and found high levels of sequence divergence at both small (<10 km) and large (>600 km) spatial scales for four of the six Collembola species. We applied molecular clock estimates and assessed genetic divergences relative to the timing of past glacial cycles, including collapses of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). We found that genetically distinct lineages within three species have likely been isolated for at least 5.54 My to 3.52 My, while the other three species diverged more recently (<2 My). We suggest that Collem-bola had greater dispersal opportunities under past warmer climates , via flotation along coastal margins. Similarly increased opportunities for dispersal may occur under contemporary climate warming scenarios, which could influence the genetic structure of extant populations. As Collembola are a living record of past landscape evolution within Antarctica, these findings provide biological evidence to support geological and glaciological estimates of historical WAIS dynamics over the last ca. 5 My},

This study was designed to investigate the phylogeographic structure of three common species of the genus Lepidocyrtus (Hexapoda: Collembola), soil-dwelling arthropods characterized by limited dispersal capabilities and generally associated with forest habitats. We observed a remarkable geographic structure, with numerous deeply divergent genetic lineages occupying islands as well as mainland sites with no apparent gene flow among most sites, even across distances of only tens of kilometres. The reconstructed time frame for the evolution of these lineages suggests divergence between 5 and 15 Ma. This indicates a remarkably ancient origin and long-term persistence of individual lineages over a fine geographic scale despite the occurrence of abrupt sea level and climatic fluctuations in the area. This further suggests that currently recognized morphological species might be a serious underestimation of the true springtail biodiversity within this region. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

It was discovered that the results of the interaction between any two species usually varied greatly depending on the mechanism involved. In some cases one mechanism stimulated population growth while another inhibited it. Given the nature of Collembola habits and habitats it is likely that one mechanism will dominate under certain circumstances and another under different ones.

As Darwin noted, natural selection can act together with other processes, including random changes in the frequencies of phenotypic differences that are not under strong selection, and changes in the environment, which may reflect evolutionary changes in the organisms themselves. As understanding of genetics developed after 1900, the new genetic discoveries were incorporated into evolutionary biology. The resulting general principles were summarized by Julian Huxley in his 1942 book Evolution: the modern synthesis. Here, we examine how recent advances in genetics, developmental biology and molecular biology, including epigenetics, relate to today’s understanding of the evolution of adaptations. We illustrate how careful genetic studies have repeatedly shown that apparently puzzling results in a wide diversity of organisms involve processes that are consistent with neo-Darwinism. They do not support important roles in adaptation for processes such as directed mutation or the inheritance of acquired characters, and therefore no radical revision of our understanding of the mechanism of adaptive evolution is needed.},

   abstract = {Conservation agriculture (CA) may become a preferred cultivation system in the future as a tool to mitigate climate change through improved carbon storage. Less is known, however, about the effect of CA on biodiversity. Yet biodiversity is also under pressure throughout the world, and the biodiversity crisis and the climate crisis should be addressed together.In the current study, the density and diversity of epiedaphic (surface-dwelling) springtails, beetles and spiders were investigated over three years on two organic and two conventional farms. The experimental set-up was a randomized block design of four blocks each with four cultivation systems: 1) conventional tillage (CT) with moldbord ploughing, 2) non-inversion tillage (NIT), 3) conservation agriculture (CA) with no-tilling except hoeing for weed control in the organic systems, 4) CA with extended utilization of cover crops (CA+) and no hoeing in the organic systems.The working hypothesis was that CA, by adding plant matter to the base, enhances a food web consisting of dead crop residues, degrading bacteria and fungi, springtails, epiedaphic spiders and beetles and, at the top, birds. This was named the “feed the food web hypothesis”. ‘Strong positive effects of the CA and CA+ systems were demonstrated in terms of density and diversity of epiedaphic springtails compared to CT and NIT in all ten datasets, which supports the “feed the food web hypothesis”. Furthermore, significant effects were found on densities of several epiedaphic springtail species or genera.  A positive effect of NIT was also detected compared to CT.The results were more inconsistent for spiders and epiedaphic beetles; positive effects of CA on densities of spiders and beetles were demonstrated, respectively, in only three and two datasets out of ten while significant effects on ground beetle species richness were found in only two datasets. The inconsistent effect of CA on spiders and beetles may be due to high mobility of these organisms which can move easily from one plot to another.The strong support for the “feed the food web hypothesis“ at the level of springtails, which constitutes the foundation for higher trophic level effects, suggests that CA can be used as a tool in biodiversity crisis mitigation.},

SAM/BAM files usually contain information from tens to hundreds of millions of reads. Often, the sequencing technology, protocol and/or the selected mapping algorithm introduce some unwanted biases in these data. The systematic detection of such biases is a non-trivial task that is crucial to drive appropriate downstream analyses.Results: We have developed Qualimap, a Java application that supports user-friendly quality control of mapping data, by considering sequence features and their genomic properties.

   abstract = {Background: BRAKER is a suite of automatic pipelines, BRAKER1 and BRAKER2, for the accurate annotation of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic genomes. Each pipeline trains statistical models of protein-coding genes based on provided evidence and, then predicts protein-coding genes in genomic sequences using both the extrinsic evidence and statistical models. For training and prediction, BRAKER1 and BRAKER2 incorporate complementary extrinsic evidence: BRAKER1 uses only RNA-seq data while BRAKER2 uses only a database of cross-species proteins. The BRAKER suite has so far not been able to reliably exceed the accuracy of BRAKER1 and BRAKER2 when incorporating both types of evidence simultaneously. Currently, for a novel genome project where both RNA-seq and protein data are available, the best option is to run both pipelines independently, and to pick one, likely better output. Therefore, one or another type of the extrinsic evidence would remain unexploited. Results: We present TSEBRA, a software that selects gene predictions (transcripts) from the sets generated by BRAKER1 and BRAKER2. TSEBRA uses a set of rules to compare scores of overlapping transcripts based on their support by RNA-seq and homologous protein evidence. We show in computational experiments on genomes of 11 species that TSEBRA achieves higher accuracy than either BRAKER1 or BRAKER2 running alone and that TSEBRA compares favorably with the combiner tool EVidenceModeler. Conclusion: TSEBRA is an easy-to-use and fast software tool. It can be used in concert with the BRAKER pipeline to generate a gene prediction set supported by both RNA-seq and homologous protein evidence.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Computational annotation of protein coding genes in genomic DNA is a widely used and essential tool for analyzing newly sequenced genomes. However, current methods suffer from inaccuracy and do poorly with certain types of genes. Including additional sources of evidence of the existence and structure of genes can improve the quality of gene predictions. For many eukaryotic genomes, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are available as evidence for genes. Related genomes that have been sequenced, annotated, and aligned to the target genome provide evidence of existence and structure of genes. Results: We incorporate several different evidence sources into the gene finder AUGUSTUS. The sources of evidence are gene and transcript annotations from related species syntenically mapped to the target genome using TRANSMAP, evolutionary conservation of DNA, mRNA and ESTs of the target species, and retroposed genes. The predictions include alternative splice variants where evidence supports it. Using only ESTs we were able to correctly predict at least one splice form exactly correct in 57% of human genes. Also using evidence from other species and human mRNAs, this number rises to 77%. Syntenic mapping is well-suited to annotate genomes closely related to genomes that are already annotated or for which extensive transcript evidence is available. Native cDNA evidence is most helpful when the alignments are used as compound information rather than independent positionwise information. © 2008 The Author(s).},

Even though many spliced alignment programs have been developed, recent rapid progress in DNA sequencing technologies demands further improvements in software tools. Benchmarking algorithms under various conditions is an indispensable task for the development of better software; however, there is a dire lack of appropriate datasets usable for benchmarking spliced alignment programs. In this study, we have constructed two types of datasets: simulated sequence datasets and actual cross-species datasets. The datasets are designed to correspond to various real situations, i.e. divergent eukaryotic species, different types of reference sequences, and the wide divergence between query and target sequences. In addition, we have developed an extended version of our program Spaln, which incorporates two additional features to the scoring scheme of the original version, and examined this extended version, Spaln2, together with the original Spaln and other representative aligners based on our benchmark datasets. Although the effects of the modifications are not individually striking, Spaln2 is consistently most accurate and reasonably fast in most practical cases, especially for plants and fungi and for increasingly divergent pairs of target and query sequences. © 2012 The Author(s).},

As DNA sequence data of genomes and transcripts are accumulating at an unprecedented rate, steady improvement in accuracy, speed and space requirement in the computational tools for mapping/ alignment is desired. We devised a multi-phase heuristic algorithm and implemented it in the development of the stand-alone computer program Spaln (space-efficient spliced alignment). Spaln is reasonably fast and space efficient; it requires < 1 Gb of memory to map and align > 120 000 Unigene sequences onto the unmasked whole human genome with a conventional computer, finishing the job in < 6 h. With artificially introduced noise of various levels, Spaln significantly outperforms other leading alignment programs currently available with respect to the accuracy of mapped exon-intron structures. This performance is achieved without extensive learning procedures to adjust parameter values to a particular organism. According to the handiness and accuracy, Spaln may be used for studies on a wide area of genome analyses. © 2008 The Author(s).},

The task is to design a work flow with a minimal set of tools that would reach state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of species. GeneMark-ET is a gene prediction tool that incorporates RNA-Seq data into unsupervised training and subsequently generates ab initio gene predictions. AUGUSTUS is a gene finder that usually requires supervised training and uses information from RNA-Seq reads in the prediction step. Complementary strengths of GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS provided motivation for designing a new combined tool for automatic gene prediction. Results: We present BRAKER1, a pipeline for unsupervised RNA-Seq-based genome annotation that combines the advantages of GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS. As input, BRAKER1 requires a genome assembly file and a file in bam-format with spliced alignments of RNA-Seq reads to the genome. First, GeneMark-ET performs iterative training and generates initial gene structures. Second, AUGUSTUS uses predicted genes for training and then integrates RNA-Seq read information into final gene predictions. In our experiments, we observed that BRAKER1 was more accurate than MAKER2 when it is using RNA-Seq as sole source for training and prediction. BRAKER1 does not require pre-trained parameters or a separate expert-prepared training step.},

Here we examined long-term trends in 923 terrestrial insect assemblages monitored in 106 studies, and found concomitant declines in abundance and species richness. For studies that were resolved to species level (551 sites in 57 studies), we observed a decline in the number of initially abundant species through time, but not in the number of very rare species. At the population level, we found that species that were most abundant at the start of the time series showed the strongest average declines (corrected for regression-to-the-mean effects). Rarer species were, on average, also declining, but these were offset by increases of other species. Our results suggest that the observed decreases in total insect abundance2 can mostly be explained by widespread declines of formerly abundant species. This counters the common narrative that biodiversity loss is mostly characterized by declines of rare species8,9. Although our results suggest that fundamental changes are occurring in insect assemblages, it is important to recognize that they represent only trends from those locations for which sufficient long-term data are available. Nevertheless, given the importance of abundant species in ecosystems10, their general declines are likely to have broad repercussions for food webs and ecosystem functioning.},

   abstract = {The accelerating pace of genome sequencing throughout the tree of life is driving the need for improved unsupervised annotation of genome components such as transposable elements (TEs). Because the types and sequences of TEs are highly variable across species, automated TE discovery and annotation are challenging and time-consuming tasks. A critical first step is the de novo identification and accurate compilation of sequence models representing all of the unique TE families dispersed in the genome. Here we introduce RepeatModeler2, a pipeline that greatly facilitates this process. This program brings substantial improvements over the original version of RepeatModeler, one of the most widely used tools for TE discovery. In particular, this version incorporates a module for structural discovery of complete long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements, which are widespread in eukaryotic genomes but recalcitrant to automated identification because of their size and sequence complexity. We benchmarked RepeatModeler2 on three model species with diverse TE landscapes and high-quality, manually curated TE libraries: Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Danio rerio (zebrafish), and Oryza sativa (rice). In these three species, RepeatModeler2 identified approximately 3 times more consensus sequences matching with >95% sequence identity and sequence coverage to the manually curated sequences than the original RepeatModeler. As expected, the greatest improvement is
for LTR retroelements. Thus, RepeatModeler2 represents a valuable addition to the genome annotation toolkit that will enhance the identification and study of TEs in eukaryotic genome sequences. RepeatModeler2 is available as source code or a containerized package under an open license (https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/RepeatModeler,  http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler/).},

   abstract = {The unprecedented rate of extinction calls for efficient use of genetics to help conserve biodiversity. Several recent genomic and simulation-based studies have argued that the field of conservation biology has placed too much focus on conserving genome-wide genetic variation, and that the field should instead focus on managing the subset of functional genetic variation that is thought to affect fitness. Here, we critically evaluate the feasibility and likely benefits of this approach in conservation. We find that population genetics theory and empirical results show that conserving genome-wide genetic variation is generally the best approach to prevent inbreeding depression and loss of adaptive potential from driving populations toward extinction. Focusing conservation efforts on presumably functional genetic variation will only be feasible occasionally, often misleading, and counterproductive when prioritized over genome-wide genetic variation. Given the increasing rate of habitat loss and other environmental changes, failure to recognize the detrimental effects of lost genome-wide genetic variation on long-term population viability will only worsen the biodiversity crisis.},

   abstract = {Summary: BWA-MEM is a new alignment algorithm for aligning sequence reads or long query sequences against a large reference genome such as human. It automatically chooses between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance than several state-of-art read aligners to date.

   abstract = {Insects constitute vital components of ecosystems. There is alarming evidence for global declines in insect species diversity, abundance, and biomass caused by anthropogenic drivers such as habitat degradation or loss, agricultural practices, climate change, and environmental pollution. This raises important concerns about human food security and ecosystem functionality and calls for more research to assess insect population trends and identify threatened species and the causes of declines to inform conservation strategies. Analysis of genetic diversity is a powerful tool to address these goals, but so far animal conservation genetics research has focused strongly on endangered vertebrates, devoting less attention to invertebrates, such as insects , that constitute most biodiversity. Insects' shorter generation times and larger population sizes likely necessitate different analytical methods and management strategies. The availability of high-quality reference genome assemblies enables population genomics to address several key issues. These include precise inference of past demographic fluctuations and recent declines , measurement of genetic load levels, delineation of evolutionarily significant units and cryptic species, and analysis of genetic adaptation to stressors. This enables identification of populations that are particularly vulnerable to future threats, considering their potential to adapt and evolve. We review the application of population genomics to insect conservation and the outlook for averting insect declines.},

Advances in genome sequencing and computational techniques now enable us to estimate the genetic load in populations and individuals without direct fitness estimates. Here, we review the classic and contemporary literature of genetic load. We describe approaches to quantify the genetic load in whole-genome sequence data based on evolutionary conservation and annotations. We show that splitting the load into its two components — the realized load (or expressed load) and the masked load (or inbreeding load) — can improve our understanding of the population genetics of deleterious mutations.},

@article{Timmermans2005,
   abstract = {Population genetic structure is determined both by current processes and historical events. Current processes include gene flow, which is largely influenced by the migration capacity of a species. Historical events are, for example, glaciation periods, which have had a major impact on the distribution of many species. Species with a low capacity or tendency to move about or disperse often exhibit clear spatial genetic structures, whereas mobile species mostly show less spatial genetic differentiation. In this paper we report on the genetic structure of a small, wingless arthropod species (Orchesella cincta: Collembola) in Europe. For this purpose we used mtDNA COII sequences and AFLP markers. We show that large genetic differences exist between populations of O. cincta, as expected from O. cincta's winglessness and sedentary lifestyle. Despite the fact that most variability was observed within populations (59%), a highly significant amount of AFLP variation (25%) was observed between populations from northwestern Europe, central Europe and Italy. This suggests that gene flow among regions is extremely low, which is additionally supported by the lack of shared mtDNA alleles between regions. Based on the genetic variation and sequence differences observed we conclude that the subdivision occurred long before the last glaciation periods. Although the populations still interbreed in the lab, we assume that in the long term the genetic isolation of these regions may lead to speciation processes. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Rapid development in long-read sequencing and scaffolding technologies is accelerating the production of reference-quality assemblies for large eukaryotic genomes. However, haplotype divergence in regions of high heterozygosity often results in assemblers creating two copies rather than one copy of a region, leading to breaks in contiguity and compromising downstream steps such as gene annotation. Several tools have been developed to resolve this problem. However, they either focus only on removing contained duplicate regions, also known as haplotigs, or fail to use all the relevant information and hence make errors. Results: Here we present a novel tool, purge_dups, that uses sequence similarity and read depth to automatically identify and remove both haplotigs and heterozygous overlaps. In comparison with current tools, we demonstrate that purge_dups can reduce heterozygous duplication and increase assembly continuity while maintaining completeness of the primary assembly. Moreover, purge_dups is fully automatic and can easily be integrated into assembly pipelines.},

Only a few genomes could serve as standards of annotation achieved through a tremendous investment of human curation efforts.

BRAKER2 continues the line started by BRAKER1 where self-Training GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS made gene predictions supported by transcriptomic data. Among the challenges addressed by the new pipeline was a generation of reliable hints to protein-coding exon boundaries from likely homologous but evolutionarily distant proteins. In comparison with other pipelines for eukaryotic genome annotation, BRAKER2 is fully automatic. It is favorably compared under equal conditions with other pipelines, e.g. MAKER2, in terms of accuracy and performance. Development of BRAKER2 should facilitate solving the task of harmonization of annotation of protein-coding genes in genomes of different eukaryotic species. However, we fully understand that several more innovations are needed in transcriptomic and proteomic technologies as well as in algorithmic development to reach the goal of highly accurate annotation of eukaryotic genomes.},

Here we describe hifiasm, a de novo assembler that takes advantage of long high-fidelity sequence reads to faithfully represent the haplotype information in a phased assembly graph. Unlike other graph-based assemblers that only aim to maintain the contiguity of one haplotype, hifiasm strives to preserve the contiguity of all haplotypes. This feature enables the development of a graph trio binning algorithm that greatly advances over standard trio binning. On three human and five nonhuman datasets, including California redwood with a ~30-Gb hexaploid genome, we show that hifiasm frequently delivers better assemblies than existing tools and consistently outperforms others on haplotype-resolved assembly.},
