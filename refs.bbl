    Environmental disturbance underpins the dynamics and diversity of many of
  the ecosystems of the world, yet its influence on the patterns and
  distribution of genetic diversity is poorly appreciated. We argue here that
  disturbance history may be the major driver that shapes patterns of genetic
  diversity in many natural populations. We outline how disturbance influences
  genetic diversity through changes in both selective processes and
  demographically driven, selectively neutral processes. Our review highlights
  the opportunities and challenges presented by genetic approaches, such as
  landscape genomics, for better understanding and predicting the demographic
  and evolutionary responses of natural populations to disturbance. Developing
  this understanding is now critical because disturbance regimes are changing
  rapidly in a human-modified world. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.%

    Laboratory microcosms containing litter from three tussock grasslands were
  used to assess the impact of grazing by a collembolan, Onychiurus
  procampatus, on the abundance, nutrient release, and respiration of the
  saprotrophic fungus, Phoma exigua. The fungal biomass and respiration rate
  were significantly reduced only when Collembola were present in excess of
  mean field densities but perhaps more typical of spatial aggregations in the
  soil. A high efficiency of nutrient immobilization by P exigua was
  demonstrated but nutrient release was not significantly affected by the
  fauna. Problems associated with the use of microcosms in the simulation of
  field conditions are discussed.%

    Genetic variation, which is generated by mutation, recombination and gene
  flow, can reduce the mean fitness of a population, both now and in the
  future. This âgenetic loadâ has been estimated in a wide range of animal
  taxa using various approaches. Advances in genome sequencing and
  computational techniques now enable us to estimate the genetic load in
  populations and individuals without direct fitness estimates. Here, we review
  the classic and contemporary literature of genetic load. We describe
  approaches to quantify the genetic load in whole-genome sequence data based
  on evolutionary conservation and annotations. We show that splitting the load
  into its two components â the realized load (or expressed load) and the
  masked load (or inbreeding load) â can improve our understanding of the
  population genetics of deleterious mutations.%

    We have made several steps toward creating a fast and accurate algorithm
  for gene prediction in eukaryotic genomes. First, we introduced an automated
  method for efficient ab initio gene finding, GeneMark-ES, with parameters
  trained in iterative unsupervised mode. Next, in GeneMark-ET we proposed a
  method of integration of unsupervised training with information on intron
  positions revealed by mapping short RNA reads. Now we describe GeneMark-EP, a
  tool that utilizes another source of external information, a protein
  database, readily available prior to the start of a sequencing project. A new
  specialized pipeline, ProtHint, initiates massive protein mapping to genome
  and extracts hints to splice sites and translation start and stop sites of
  potential genes. GeneMark-EP uses the hints to improve estimation of model
  parameters as well as to adjust coordinates of predicted genes if they
  disagree with the most reliable hints (the -EP+ mode). Tests of GeneMark-EP
  and -EP+ demonstrated improvements in gene prediction accuracy in comparison
  with GeneMark-ES, while the GeneMark-EP+ showed higher accuracy than
  GeneMark-ET. We have observed that the most pronounced improvements in gene
  prediction accuracy happened in large eukaryotic genomes.%

    The task of eukaryotic genome annotation remains challenging. Only a few
  genomes could serve as standards of annotation achieved through a tremendous
  investment of human curation efforts. Still, the correctness of all
  alternative isoforms, even in the best-Annotated genomes, could be a good
  subject for further investigation. The new BRAKER2 pipeline generates and
  integrates external protein support into the iterative process of training
  and gene prediction by GeneMark-EP+ and AUGUSTUS. BRAKER2 continues the line
  started by BRAKER1 where self-Training GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS made gene
  predictions supported by transcriptomic data. Among the challenges addressed
  by the new pipeline was a generation of reliable hints to protein-coding exon
  boundaries from likely homologous but evolutionarily distant proteins. In
  comparison with other pipelines for eukaryotic genome annotation, BRAKER2 is
  fully automatic. It is favorably compared under equal conditions with other
  pipelines, e.g. MAKER2, in terms of accuracy and performance. Development of
  BRAKER2 should facilitate solving the task of harmonization of annotation of
  protein-coding genes in genomes of different eukaryotic species. However, we
  fully understand that several more innovations are needed in transcriptomic
  and proteomic technologies as well as in algorithmic development to reach the
  goal of highly accurate annotation of eukaryotic genomes.%

    The alignment of sequencing reads against a protein reference database is a
  major computational bottleneck in metagenomics and data-intensive
  evolutionary projects. Although recent tools offer improved performance over
  the gold standard BLASTX, they exhibit only a modest speedup or low
  sensitivity. We introduce DIAMOND, an open-source algorithm based on double
  indexing that is 20,000 times faster than BLASTX on short reads and has a
  similar degree of sensitivity.%

    The role of natural selection in the evolution of adaptive phenotypes has
  undergone constant probing by evolutionary biologists, employing both
  theoretical and empirical approaches. As Darwin noted, natural selection can
  act together with other processes, including random changes in the
  frequencies of phenotypic differences that are not under strong selection,
  and changes in the environment, which may reflect evolutionary changes in the
  organisms themselves. As understanding of genetics developed after 1900, the
  new genetic discoveries were incorporated into evolutionary biology. The
  resulting general principles were summarized by Julian Huxley in his 1942
  book Evolution: the modern synthesis. Here, we examine how recent advances in
  genetics, developmental biology and molecular biology, including epigenetics,
  relate to todayâs understanding of the evolution of adaptations. We
  illustrate how careful genetic studies have repeatedly shown that apparently
  puzzling results in a wide diversity of organisms involve processes that are
  consistent with neo-Darwinism. They do not support important roles in
  adaptation for processes such as directed mutation or the inheritance of
  acquired characters, and therefore no radical revision of our understanding
  of the mechanism of adaptive evolution is needed.%

    Haplotype-resolved de novo assembly is the ultimate solution to the study
  of sequence variations in a genome. However, existing algorithms either
  collapse heterozygous alleles into one consensus copy or fail to cleanly
  separate the haplotypes to produce high-quality phased assemblies. Here we
  describe hifiasm, a de novo assembler that takes advantage of long
  high-fidelity sequence reads to faithfully represent the haplotype
  information in a phased assembly graph. Unlike other graph-based assemblers
  that only aim to maintain the contiguity of one haplotype, hifiasm strives to
  preserve the contiguity of all haplotypes. This feature enables the
  development of a graph trio binning algorithm that greatly advances over
  standard trio binning. On three human and five nonhuman datasets, including
  California redwood with a ~30-Gb hexaploid genome, we show that hifiasm
  frequently delivers better assemblies than existing tools and consistently
  outperforms others on haplotype-resolved assembly.%

    The effect on population growth of interspecific interactions was studied
  among 4 species of Collembola: Folsomia candida Willem, Xenylla grÃ­sea
  AXELSON, Sinella caeca (scnoÏÏ) and Pseudo-sinella violenta Folsom under
  laboratory conditions. Interaction was examined mediated by three different
  mechanisms: direct interaction, substrate conditioning and airborne
  allomones. It was discovered that the results of the interaction between any
  two species usually varied greatly depending on the mechanism involved. In
  some cases one mechanism stimulated population growth while another inhibited
  it. Given the nature of Collembola habits and habitats it is likely that one
  mechanism will dominate under certain circumstances and another under
  different ones. The result is that it is impossible to categorize the
  interspecific interactions we observed by any of the standard terms for such
  interactions such as competition amensalism or cooperation.%

    The North-Western Mediterranean basin is well known for its high number of
  relictual endemic taxa, and has been indicated as one of the world's major
  biodiversity hotspots at the species level. A possible contributing factor
  may be long-term persistence of populations and their prolonged stability.
  This study was designed to investigate the phylogeographic structure of three
  common species of the genus Lepidocyrtus (Hexapoda: Collembola),
  soil-dwelling arthropods characterized by limited dispersal capabilities and
  generally associated with forest habitats. We observed a remarkable
  geographic structure, with numerous deeply divergent genetic lineages
  occupying islands as well as mainland sites with no apparent gene flow among
  most sites, even across distances of only tens of kilometres. The
  reconstructed time frame for the evolution of these lineages suggests
  divergence between 5 and 15 Ma. This indicates a remarkably ancient origin
  and long-term persistence of individual lineages over a fine geographic scale
  despite the occurrence of abrupt sea level and climatic fluctuations in the
  area. This further suggests that currently recognized morphological species
  might be a serious underestimation of the true springtail biodiversity within
  this region. Â© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.%

    During austral summer field seasons between 1999 and 2018, we sampled at 91
  locations throughout southern Victoria Land and along the Transantarctic
  Mountains for six species of endemic microarthropods (Collembola), covering a
  latitudinal range from 76.0Â°S to 87.3Â°S. We assembled individual
  mitochondrial cyto-chrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) sequences (n = 866) and
  found high levels of sequence divergence at both small (<10 km) and large
  (>600 km) spatial scales for four of the six Collembola species. We applied
  molecular clock estimates and assessed genetic divergences relative to the
  timing of past glacial cycles, including collapses of the West Antarctic Ice
  Sheet (WAIS). We found that genetically distinct lineages within three
  species have likely been isolated for at least 5.54 My to 3.52 My, while the
  other three species diverged more recently (<2 My). We suggest that
  Collem-bola had greater dispersal opportunities under past warmer climates ,
  via flotation along coastal margins. Similarly increased opportunities for
  dispersal may occur under contemporary climate warming scenarios, which could
  influence the genetic structure of extant populations. As Collembola are a
  living record of past landscape evolution within Antarctica, these findings
  provide biological evidence to support geological and glaciological estimates
  of historical WAIS dynamics over the last ca. 5 My%

    Soil-living animals such as collembolans, earthworms and isopods are
  considered to be sedentary animals with only limited dispersal capacities.
  Therefore, gene flow among populations is expected to be low leading to
  significant population genetic differentiation due to random drift and local
  adaptation. We reviewed the literature to test this expectation. Our survey
  reveals a clear signature in the current pattern of genetic variation due to
  post-glacial colonization events. It also reveals that habitus can be a
  misleading predictor of dispersal capacity. In some species relatively high
  gene flow across considerable distances, most likely through passive
  dispersal (mediated by wind, water flow or animals), might counteract local
  genetic adaptation and will prevent loss of genetic variation. Â© 2013

    \field{abstract}{%
    Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the largest threats to amphibian
  populations. However, most studies have not provided clear insights into
  their population-level implications. There is a critical need to investigate
  the mechanisms that underlie patterns of distribution and abundance. In order
  to understand the population- and species-level implications of habitat loss
  and fragmentation, it is necessary to move from site-specific inferences to
  assessments of how the influences of multiple factors interact across
  extensive landscapes to influence population size and population
  connectivity. The goal of this paper is to summarize the state of knowledge,
  identify information gaps and suggest research approaches to provide reliable
  knowledge and effective conservation of amphibians in landscapes experiencing
  habitat loss and fragmentation. Reliable inferences require attention to
  species-specific ecological characteristics and their interactions with
  environmental conditions at a range of spatial scales. Habitat connectivity
  appears to play a key role in regional viability of amphibian populations. In
  amphibians, population connectivity is predominantly effected through
  juvenile dispersal. The preponderance of evidence suggests that the
  short-term impact of habitat loss and fragmentation increases with dispersal
  ability. However, species with limited dispersal abilities are likely to be
  equally imperiled by habitat loss and fragmentation over longer time periods.
  Rigorous understanding of the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on
  amphibians will require species-specific, multi-scale, mechanistic
  investigations, and will be benefit from integrating large empirical field
  studies with molecular genetics and simulation modeling. Molecular genetic
  methods are particularly suited to quantifying the influences of habitat
  structure across large spatial extents on gene flow and population
  connectivity. Conservation strategies would benefit by moving from
  generalizations to species and process specific recommendations and by moving
  from site-specific actions to implementing conservation plans at multiple
  scales across broad landscapes. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.%

    Background: SAMtools and BCFtools are widely used programs for processing
  and analysing high-throughput sequencing data. They include tools for file
  format conversion and manipulation, sorting, querying, statistics, variant
  calling, and effect analysis amongst other methods. Findings: The first
  version appeared online 12 years ago and has been maintained and further
  developed ever since, with many new features and improvements added over the
  years. The SAMtools and BCFtools packages represent a unique collection of
  tools that have been used in numerous other software projects and countless
  genomic pipelines. Conclusion: Both SAMtools and BCFtools are freely
  available on GitHub under the permissive MIT licence, free for both
  non-commercial and commercial use. Both packages have been installed >1
  million times via Bioconda. The source code and documentation are available
  from https://www.htslib.org.%

    Between 1990 and 2000, farmland birds showed a significant decline across
  Europe, a trend not shared by bird assemblages of other habitats over the
  same period. Mean trends for each farmland species in the period 1990-2000
  were positively correlated with trends over the period 1970-1990, and there
  was little change in population trajectory for most species over the 30-year
  period. Of the 58 species classed by an independent assessment as being
  primarily birds of farmland, 41 showed negative overall mean trends across
  Europe in 1990-2000, 19 of them significant. There was a significant negative
  correlation between mean national trends of all farmland species and indices
  of national agricultural intensity. This relationship strengthened when the
  19 declining species were considered alone, and was not apparent when only
  non-declining species were considered. Population trends of terrestrial
  non-farmland bird species over the same period were unrelated to agricultural
  intensity. Trends in farmland bird populations were independent of the
  proportion of farmland under agri-environment prescriptions. The results
  support earlier evidence that population trends of farmland birds across
  Europe can be predicted from gross national agricultural statistics.
  Substantial changes in agricultural policy, particularly the removal of
  economic incentives that lead to agricultural intensification, are required
  if 2010 targets for halting loss of biodiversity are to be met in an enlarged
  European Union. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.%

    The Zika outbreak, spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, highlights the
  need to create high-quality assemblies of large genomes in a rapid and
  cost-effective way. Here we combine Hi-C data with existing draft assemblies
  to generate chromosome-length scaffolds. We validate this method by
  assembling a human genome, de novo, from short reads alone (67Ã coverage).
  We then combine our method with draft sequences to create genome assemblies
  of the mosquito disease vectors Ae. aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, each
  consisting of three scaffolds corresponding to the three chromosomes in each
  species. These assemblies indicate that almost all genomic rearrangements
  among these species occur within, rather than between, chromosome arms. The
  genome assembly procedure we describe is fast, inexpensive, and accurate, and
  can be applied to many species.%

    Genetic polymorphism varies among species and within genomes, and has
  important implications for the evolution and conservation of species. The
  determinants of this variation have been poorly understood, but population
  genomic data from a wide range of organisms now make it possible to delineate
  the underlying evolutionary processes, notably how variation in the effective
  population size (N e) governs genetic diversity. Comparative population
  genomics is on its way to providing a solution to 'Lewontin's paradox'-the
  discrepancy between the many orders of magnitude of variation in population
  size and the much narrower distribution of diversity levels. It seems that
  linked selection plays an important part both in the overall genetic
  diversity of a species and in the variation in diversity within the genome.
  Genetic diversity also seems to be predictable from the life history of a
  species.%

    Population bottlenecks occur frequently in threatened species and result in
  loss of genetic diversity and evolutionary potential. These may range in
  severity between short intense bottlenecks, and more diffuse bottlenecks over
  many generations. However, there is little information on the impacts of
  different types of bottlenecks and disagreement as to their likely impacts.
  To resolve this issue, we subjected replicate Drosophila populations to
  intense bottlenecks , consisting of one pair over a single generation, versus
  diffuse bottlenecks consisting of an effective size of 100 over 57
  generations. The intense and diffuse bottlenecks were designed to induce
  identical losses of hetero-zygosity. However, computer simulations showed
  that the probability of retaining alleles is lower in the intense than the
  diffuse bottleneck treatment. The effects of these bottlenecks on genetic
  diversity at nine microsatellite loci in Drosophila were evaluated.
  Bottlenecks substantially reduced allelic diversity, heterozygosity and
  proportion of loci polymorphic, changed allele frequency distributions and
  resulted in large differences among replicate populations. Allelic diversity,
  scaled by heterozygosity, was lower in the intense than the diffuse
  treatments. Short-term evolutionary potential, measured as the ability of
  bottlenecked populations to cope with increasing concentrations of NaCl, did
  not differ between the intense and diffuse bottlenecked populations. The
  effects of bottlenecks on short-term evolutionary potential relate to loss of
  heterozygosity, rather than allelic diversity.%

    We introduce a flexible and robust simulation-based framework to infer
  demographic parameters from the site frequency spectrum (SFS) computed on
  large genomic datasets. We show that our composite-likelihood approach allows
  one to study evolutionary models of arbitrary complexity, which cannot be
  tackled by other current likelihood-based methods. For simple scenarios, our
  approach compares favorably in terms of accuracy and speed with âaâi, the
  current reference in the field, while showing better convergence properties
  for complex models. We first apply our methodology to non-coding genomic SNP
  data from four human populations. To infer their demographic history, we
  compare neutral evolutionary models of increasing complexity, including
  unsampled populations. We further show the versatility of our framework by
  extending it to the inference of demographic parameters from SNP chips with
  known ascertainment, such as that recently released by Affymetrix to study
  human origins. Whereas previous ways of handling ascertained SNPs were either
  restricted to a single population or only allowed the inference of divergence
  time between a pair of populations, our framework can correctly infer
  parameters of more complex models including the divergence of several
  populations, bottlenecks and migration. We apply this approach to the
  reconstruction of African demography using two distinct ascertained human SNP
  panels studied under two evolutionary models. The two SNP panels lead to
  globally very similar estimates and confidence intervals, and suggest an
  ancient divergence (>110 Ky) between Yoruba and San populations. Our
  methodology appears well suited to the study of complex scenarios from large
  genomic data sets. Â© 2013 Excoffier et al.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The accelerating pace of genome sequencing throughout the tree of life is
  driving the need for improved unsupervised annotation of genome components
  such as transposable elements (TEs). Because the types and sequences of TEs
  are highly variable across species, automated TE discovery and annotation are
  challenging and time-consuming tasks. A critical first step is the de novo
  identification and accurate compilation of sequence models representing all
  of the unique TE families dispersed in the genome. Here we introduce
  RepeatModeler2, a pipeline that greatly facilitates this process. This
  program brings substantial improvements over the original version of
  RepeatModeler, one of the most widely used tools for TE discovery. In
  particular, this version incorporates a module for structural discovery of
  complete long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements, which are widespread in
  eukaryotic genomes but recalcitrant to automated identification because of
  their size and sequence complexity. We benchmarked RepeatModeler2 on three
  model species with diverse TE landscapes and high-quality, manually curated
  TE libraries: Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Danio rerio (zebrafish),
  and Oryza sativa (rice). In these three species, RepeatModeler2 identified
  approximately 3 times more consensus sequences matching with >95% sequence
  identity and sequence coverage to the manually curated sequences than the
  original RepeatModeler. As expected, the greatest improvement is for LTR
  retroelements. Thus, RepeatModeler2 represents a valuable addition to the
  genome annotation toolkit that will enhance the identification and study of
  TEs in eukaryotic genome sequences. RepeatModeler2 is available as source
  code or a containerized package under an open license

    Counts of several Collembola species in a rotation of grass and wheat
  cropping were consistently lower under a conventional regime of pesticide use
  than under a reduced-input regime. During a six-year period (1991â1996),
  counts of Entomobrya nicoleti remained at or close to zero under the
  conventional regime. This raised the question of how long recovery would take
  if conventional pesticide inputs ceased. To answer this question, and confirm
  effects of the pesticide regimes on patchily distributed species, the two
  pesticide regimes were reversed spatially: from 1997 to 1999 the area
  formerly under conventional inputs subsequently received the reduced-input
  regime and vice versa. This paper presents results up to summer 1998 to show
  the effect on collembolan counts of reversing the pesticide regimes.
  Responses varied among species: after conversion of the conventional regime
  to reduced inputs, counts of E. nicoleti remained at or close to zero whereas
  counts of Isotoma viridis were the highest recorded during the study. Data
  from a rotation of cereals and break crops show that reversal of treatments
  can aid interpretation of pesticide effects for species with a patchy
  temporal distribution; treatment reversal improved confidence in the
  interpretation of pesticide effects for species of Collembola which were not
  present during the pre-treatment sampling phase of a long-term study.%

    The role of genetic factors in extinction has been a controversial issue,
  especially since Lande's paper [Genetics and demography in biological
  conservation, Science 241 (1988) 1455-1460] paper in Science. Here I review
  the evidence on the contribution of genetic factors to extinction risk.
  Inbreeding depression, loss of genetic diversity and mutation accumulation
  have been hypothesised to increase extinction risk. There is now compelling
  evidence that inbreeding depression and loss of genetic diversity increase
  extinction risk in laboratory populations of naturally outbreeding species.
  There is now clear evidence for inbreeding depression in wild species of
  naturally outbreeding species and strong grounds from individual case studies
  and from computer projections for believing that this contributes to
  extinction risk. Further, most species are not driven to extinction before
  genetic factors have time to impact. The contributions of mutation
  accumulation to extinction risk in threatened taxa appear to be small and to
  require very many generations. Thus, there is now sufficient evidence to
  regard the controversies regarding the contribution of genetic factors to
  extinction risk as resolved. If genetic factors are ignored, extinction risk
  will be underestimated and inappropriate recovery strategies may be used. Â©

    Background: BRAKER is a suite of automatic pipelines, BRAKER1 and BRAKER2,
  for the accurate annotation of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic genomes.
  Each pipeline trains statistical models of protein-coding genes based on
  provided evidence and, then predicts protein-coding genes in genomic
  sequences using both the extrinsic evidence and statistical models. For
  training and prediction, BRAKER1 and BRAKER2 incorporate complementary
  extrinsic evidence: BRAKER1 uses only RNA-seq data while BRAKER2 uses only a
  database of cross-species proteins. The BRAKER suite has so far not been able
  to reliably exceed the accuracy of BRAKER1 and BRAKER2 when incorporating
  both types of evidence simultaneously. Currently, for a novel genome project
  where both RNA-seq and protein data are available, the best option is to run
  both pipelines independently, and to pick one, likely better output.
  Therefore, one or another type of the extrinsic evidence would remain
  unexploited. Results: We present TSEBRA, a software that selects gene
  predictions (transcripts) from the sets generated by BRAKER1 and BRAKER2.
  TSEBRA uses a set of rules to compare scores of overlapping transcripts based
  on their support by RNA-seq and homologous protein evidence. We show in
  computational experiments on genomes of 11 species that TSEBRA achieves
  higher accuracy than either BRAKER1 or BRAKER2 running alone and that TSEBRA
  compares favorably with the combiner tool EVidenceModeler. Conclusion: TSEBRA
  is an easy-to-use and fast software tool. It can be used in concert with the
  BRAKER pipeline to generate a gene prediction set supported by both RNA-seq
  and homologous protein evidence.%

    Motivation: The sequence alignment/map (SAM) and the binary alignment/map
  (BAM) formats have become the standard method of representation of nucleotide
  sequence alignments for next-generation sequencing data. SAM/BAM files
  usually contain information from tens to hundreds of millions of reads.
  Often, the sequencing technology, protocol and/or the selected mapping
  algorithm introduce some unwanted biases in these data. The systematic
  detection of such biases is a non-trivial task that is crucial to drive
  appropriate downstream analyses.Results: We have developed Qualimap, a Java
  application that supports user-friendly quality control of mapping data, by
  considering sequence features and their genomic properties. Qualimap takes
  sequence alignment data and provides graphical and statistical analyses for
  the evaluation of data. Such quality-control data are vital for highlighting
  problems in the sequencing and/or mapping processes, which must be addressed
  prior to further analyses. Â© The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University

    Policy aimed at conserving biodiversity has focused on species diversity.
  Loss of genetic diversity, however, can affect population persistence,
  evolutionary potential, and individual fitness. Although mammals are a
  well-studied taxonomic group, a comprehensive assessment of mammalian genetic
  diversity based on modern molecular markers is lacking. We examined published
  microsatellite data from populations of 108 mammalian species to evaluate
  background patterns of genetic variability across taxa and body masses. We
  tested for loss of genetic diversity at the population level by asking
  whether populations that experienced demographic threats exhibited lower
  levels of genetic diversity. We also evaluated the effect of ascertainment
  bias (a reduction in variability when microsatellite primers are transferred
  across species) on our assessment of genetic diversity. Heterozygosity did
  not vary with body mass across species ranging in size from shrews to whales.
  Differences across taxonomic groupings were noted at the highest level,
  between populations of marsupial and placental mammals. We documented
  consistently lower heterozygosity, however, in populations that had
  experienced demographic threats across a wide range of mammalian species. We
  also documented a significant (p = 0.01) reduction in heterozygosity as a
  result of ascertainment bias. Our results suggest that populations of both
  rare and common mammals are currently losing genetic diversity and that
  conservation efforts focused above the population level may fail to protect
  the breadth of persisting genetic diversity. Conservation policy makers may
  need to focus their efforts below the species level to stem further losses of
  genetic resources. Â©2005 Society for Conservation Biology.%

    Comparative phylogeography can reveal processes and historical events that
  shape the biodiversity of species and communities. As part of a comparative
  research program, the phylogeography of a new, endemic Australian genus and
  species of log-dependent (saproxylic) collembola was investigated using
  mitochondrial sequences, allozymes and anonymous single-copy nuclear markers.
  We found the genetic structure of the species corresponds with five a priori
  microbiogeographical regions, with population subdivision at various depths
  owing to palaeoclimatic influences. Closely related mtDNA haplotypes are
  co-distributed within a single region or occur in adjacent regions, nuclear
  allele frequencies are more similar among more proximate populations, and
  interpopulation migration is rare. Based on mtDNA divergence, a late
  Miocene-late Pliocene coalescence is likely. The present-day distribution of
  genetic diversity seems to have been impacted by three major climatic events:
  Pliocene cooling and drying (2.5-7 million years before present, Mybp), early
  Pleistocene wet-dry oscillations (c. 1.2 Mybp) and the more recent
  glacial-interglacial cycles that have characterized the latter part of the
  Quaternary (< 0.4 Mybp).%

    Balancing selection can maintain immunogenetic variation within host
  populations, but detecting its signal in a postbottlenecked population is
  challenging due to the potentially overriding effects of drift. Toll-like
  receptor genes (TLRs) play a fundamental role in vertebrate immune defence
  and are predicted to be under balancing selection. We previously
  characterized variation at TLR loci in the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus
  sechellensis), an endemic passerine that has undergone a historical
  bottleneck. Five of seven TLR loci were polymorphic, which is in sharp
  contrast to the low genomewide variation observed. However, standard
  population genetic statistical methods failed to detect a contemporary
  signature of selection at any TLR locus. We examined whether the observed TLR
  polymorphism could be explained by neutral evolution, simulating the
  population's demography in the software DIYABC. This showed that the
  posterior distributions of mutation rates had to be unrealistically high to
  explain the observed genetic variation. We then conducted simulations with an
  agent-based model using typical values for the mutation rate, which indicated
  that weak balancing selection has acted on the three TLR genes. The model was
  able to detect evidence of past selection elevating TLR polymorphism in the
  prebottleneck populations, but was unable to discern any effects of balancing
  selection in the contemporary population. Our results show drift is the
  overriding evolutionary force that has shaped TLR variation in the
  contemporary Seychelles warbler population, and the observed TLR
  polymorphisms might be merely the âghost of selection pastâ. Forecast
  models predict immunogenetic variation in this species will continue to be
  eroded in the absence of contemporary balancing selection. Such âdrift
  debtâ occurs when a gene pool has not yet reached its new equilibrium level
  of polymorphism, and this loss could be an important threat to many recently
  bottlenecked populations.%

    Aim This paper presents a tool for long-term global change studies; it is
  an update of the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) with
  estimates of some of the underlying demographic and agricultural driving
  factors.Methods Historical population, cropland and pasture statistics are
  combined with satellite information and specific allocation algorithms (which
  change over time) to create spatially explicit maps, which are fully
  consistent on a 5â² longitude/latitude grid resolution, and cover the period
  10,000 bc to ad 2000.Results Cropland occupied roughly less than 1% of the
  global ice-free land area for a long time until ad 1000, similar to the area
  used for pasture. In the centuries that followed, the share of global
  cropland increased to 2% in ad 1700 (c. 3 million km2) and 11% in ad 2000 (15
  million km2), while the share of pasture area grew from 2% in ad 1700 to 24%
  in ad 2000 (34 million km2) These profound land-use changes have had, and
  will continue to have, quite considerable consequences for global
  biogeochemical cycles, and subsequently global climate change.Main
  conclusions Some researchers suggest that humans have shifted from living in
  the Holocene (emergence of agriculture) into the Anthropocene (humans capable
  of changing the Earth's atmosphere) since the start of the Industrial
  Revolution. But in the light of the sheer size and magnitude of some
  historical land-use changes (e.g. as result of the depopulation of Europe due
  to the Black Death in the 14th century and the aftermath of the colonization
  of the Americas in the 16th century) we believe that this point might have
  occurred earlier in time. While there are still many uncertainties and gaps
  in our knowledge about the importance of land use (change) in the global
  biogeochemical cycle, we hope that this database can help global (climate)
  change modellers to close parts of this gap. Â© 2010 Blackwell Publishing

    The mapping and alignment of transcripts (cDNA, expressed sequence tag or
  amino acid sequences) onto a genomic sequence is a fundamental step for
  genome annotation, including gene finding and analyses of transcriptional
  activity, alternative splicing and nucleotide polymorphisms. As DNA sequence
  data of genomes and transcripts are accumulating at an unprecedented rate,
  steady improvement in accuracy, speed and space requirement in the
  computational tools for mapping/ alignment is desired. We devised a
  multi-phase heuristic algorithm and implemented it in the development of the
  stand-alone computer program Spaln (space-efficient spliced alignment). Spaln
  is reasonably fast and space efficient; it requires < 1 Gb of memory to map
  and align > 120 000 Unigene sequences onto the unmasked whole human genome
  with a conventional computer, finishing the job in < 6 h. With artificially
  introduced noise of various levels, Spaln significantly outperforms other
  leading alignment programs currently available with respect to the accuracy
  of mapped exon-intron structures. This performance is achieved without
  extensive learning procedures to adjust parameter values to a particular
  organism. According to the handiness and accuracy, Spaln may be used for
  studies on a wide area of genome analyses. Â© 2008 The Author(s).%

    Motivation: Rapid development in long-read sequencing and scaffolding
  technologies is accelerating the production of reference-quality assemblies
  for large eukaryotic genomes. However, haplotype divergence in regions of
  high heterozygosity often results in assemblers creating two copies rather
  than one copy of a region, leading to breaks in contiguity and compromising
  downstream steps such as gene annotation. Several tools have been developed
  to resolve this problem. However, they either focus only on removing
  contained duplicate regions, also known as haplotigs, or fail to use all the
  relevant information and hence make errors. Results: Here we present a novel
  tool, purge_dups, that uses sequence similarity and read depth to
  automatically identify and remove both haplotigs and heterozygous overlaps.
  In comparison with current tools, we demonstrate that purge_dups can reduce
  heterozygous duplication and increase assembly continuity while maintaining
  completeness of the primary assembly. Moreover, purge_dups is fully automatic
  and can easily be integrated into assembly pipelines.%

    Migration is essential for maintaining genetic diversity among populations,
  and pumas (Puma concolor) provide an excellent model for studying the genetic
  impacts of migrants on populations isolated by increasing human development.
  In densely populated southern California, USA, puma populations on the east
  and west side of interstate highway 15 (I-15) have become fragmented into a
  small inbred population on the west side (Santa Ana Mountains) and a
  relatively larger, more diverse population on the east side (Eastern
  Peninsular Range). From 146 sampled pumas, genetic analyses indicate seven
  pumas crossed I-15 over the last 15 years, including four males from west to
  east, and three males from east to west. However, only a single migrant
  (named M86) was detected to have produced offspring and contribute to gene
  flow across the I-15 barrier. Prior to the M86 migration, the Santa Ana
  population exhibited inbreeding and had significantly lower genetic diversity
  than the Eastern Peninsular Range population. After M86 emigrated, he sired
  11 offspring with Santa Ana females, decreasing inbreeding measures and
  raising heterozygosity to levels similar to pumas in the Eastern Peninsular
  Range. The emigration of M86 also introduced new alleles into the Santa Ana
  population, although allelic richness still remained significantly lower than
  the Eastern Peninsular population. Our results clearly show the benefit of a
  single migrant to the genetics of a small, isolated population. However,
  ongoing development and habitat loss on both sides of I-15 will increasingly
  strengthen the barrier to successful migration. Furthermonitoring, and
  potential human intervention, including minimizing development effects on
  connectivity, adding or improving freeway crossing structures, or animal
  translocation, may be needed to ensure adequate gene flow and long-term
  persistence of the Santa Ana puma population.%

    Analysis of the spatial genetic structure within continuous populations in
  their natural habitat can reveal acting evolutionary processes. Spatial
  autocorrelation statistics are often used for this purpose, but their
  relationships with population genetics models have not been thoroughly
  established. Moreover, it has been argued that the dependency of these
  statistics on variation in mutation rates among loci strongly limits their
  interest for inferential purposes. In the context of an isolation by distance
  process, we describe relationships between a descriptor of the spatial
  genetic structure used in empirical studies, Moran's I statistic and
  population genetics parameters. In particular, we point out that, when
  Moran's I statistic is used to describe correlation in allele frequencies at
  the individual level, it provides an estimator of Wright's coefficient of
  relationship. We also show that the latter parameter, as a descriptor of
  genetic structure, is not influenced by selfing rate or ploidy level. Under
  specific finite population models, numerical simulations show that values of
  Moran's I statistic can be predicted from analytical theory. These
  simulations are also used to estimate the time taken to approach a structure
  at equilibrium. Finally, we discuss the conditions under which spatial
  autocorrelation statistics are little influenced by variation in mutation
  rates, so that they could be used to estimate gene dispersal parameters.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Explaining the selective forces that underlie different reproductive modes
  forms a major part of evolution research. Many organisms are facultative
  sexuals, with the ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually. Reduced
  sequencing costs means it is now possible to start investigating genome
  sequences of a wider number of these organisms in depth, but teasing apart
  the genetic forces underlying the maintenance of facultative sexual
  reproduction remains a challenge. An analogous problem exists when
  determining the genetic consequences of a degree of outcrossing (and
  recombination) in otherwise self-fertilizing organisms. Here, I provide an
  overview of existing research on the evolutionary basis behind different
  reproductive modes, with a focus on explaining the population genetic effects
  favouring low outcrossing rates in either partially selfing or asexual
  species. I review the outcomes that both self-fertilization and asexuality
  have on either purging deleterious mutations or fixing beneficial alleles,
  and what empirical data exist to support these theories. In particular, a
  greater application of mathematical models to genomic data has provided
  insight into the numerous effects that transitions to self-fertilization from
  outcrossing have on genetic architecture. Similar modelling approaches could
  be used to determine the forces shaping genetic diversity of facultative
  sexual species. Hence, a further unification of mathematical models with
  next-generation sequence data will prove important in exploring the genetic
  influences on reproductive system evolution.%

    Motivation: Gene finding in eukaryotic genomes is notoriously difficult to
  automate. The task is to design a work flow with a minimal set of tools that
  would reach state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of species.
  GeneMark-ET is a gene prediction tool that incorporates RNA-Seq data into
  unsupervised training and subsequently generates ab initio gene predictions.
  AUGUSTUS is a gene finder that usually requires supervised training and uses
  information from RNA-Seq reads in the prediction step. Complementary
  strengths of GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS provided motivation for designing a new
  combined tool for automatic gene prediction. Results: We present BRAKER1, a
  pipeline for unsupervised RNA-Seq-based genome annotation that combines the
  advantages of GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS. As input, BRAKER1 requires a genome
  assembly file and a file in bam-format with spliced alignments of RNA-Seq
  reads to the genome. First, GeneMark-ET performs iterative training and
  generates initial gene structures. Second, AUGUSTUS uses predicted genes for
  training and then integrates RNA-Seq read information into final gene
  predictions. In our experiments, we observed that BRAKER1 was more accurate
  than MAKER2 when it is using RNA-Seq as sole source for training and
  prediction. BRAKER1 does not require pre-trained parameters or a separate
  expert-prepared training step.%

    BRAKER is a pipeline for highly accurate and fully automated gene
  prediction in novel eukaryotic genomes. It combines two major tools:
  GeneMark-ES/ET and AUGUSTUS. GeneMark-ES/ET learns its parameters from a
  novel genomic sequence in a fully automated fashion; if available, it uses
  extrinsic evidence for model refinement. From the protein-coding genes
  predicted by GeneMark-ES/ET, we select a set for training AUGUSTUS, one of
  the most accurate gene finding tools that, in contrast to GeneMark-ES/ET,
  integrates extrinsic evidence already into the gene prediction step. The
  first published version, BRAKER1, integrated genomic footprints of
  unassembled RNA-Seq reads into the training as well as into the prediction
  steps. The pipeline has since been extended to the integration of data on
  mapped cross-species proteins, and to the usage of heterogeneous extrinsic
  evidence, both RNA-Seq and protein alignments. In this book chapter, we
  briefly summarize the pipeline methodology and describe how to apply BRAKER
  in environments characterized by various combinations of external evidence.%

    Conservation research is dominated by vertebrate examples but the shorter
  generation times and high local population sizes of invertebrates may lead to
  very different management strategies, particularly for species with low
  movement rates. Here we investigate the genetic structure of an endangered
  flightless grasshopper, Keyacris scurra, which was used in classical
  evolutionary studies in the 1960s. It had a wide distribution across New
  South Wales (NSW) and Victoria in pre-European times but has now become
  threatened because of land clearing for agriculture and other activities. We
  revisited remnant sites of K.Â scurra, with populations now restricted to
  only one area in Victoria and a few small patches in NSW and the Australian
  Capital Territory (ACT). Using DArtseq to generate SNP markers as well as
  mtDNA sequence data, we show that the remaining Victorian populations in an
  isolated valley are genetically distinct from the NSW populations and that
  all populations tend to be genetically unique, with large FST values up to
  0.8 being detected for the SNP datasets. We also find that, with one notable
  exception, the NSW/ACT populations separate genetically into previously
  described chromosomal races (2nÂ =Â 15 vs. 2nÂ =Â 17). Isolation by distance
  was detected across both the SNP and mtDNA datasets, and there was
  substantial differentiation within chromosomal races. Genetic diversity as
  measured by heterozygosity was not correlated with the size of remaining
  habitat where the populations were found, with high variation present in some
  remnant cemetery sites. However, inbreeding correlated negatively with
  estimated habitat size at 25â500Â m patch radius. These findings emphasize
  the importance of small habitat areas in conserving genetic variation in such
  species with low mobility, and they highlight populations suitable for future
  translocation efforts.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Conservation tillage (CT) is practised on 45 million ha world-wide,
  predominantly in North and South America but its uptake is also increasing in
  South Africa, Australia and other semi-arid areas of the world. It is
  primarily used as a means to protect soils from erosion and compaction, to
  conserve moisture and reduce production costs. In Europe, the area cultivated
  using minimum tillage is increasing primarily in an effort to reduce
  production costs, but also as a way of preventing soil erosion and retain
  soil moisture. A large proportion (16%) of Europe's cultivated land is also
  prone to soil degradation but farmers and governments are being slow to
  recognise and address the problem, despite the widespread environmental
  problems that can occur when soils become degraded. Conservation tillage can
  improve soil structure and stability thereby facilitating better drainage and
  water holding capacity that reduces the extremes of water logging and
  drought. These improvements to soil structure also reduce the risk of runoff
  and pollution of surface waters with sediment, pesticides and nutrients.
  Reducing the intensity of soil cultivation lowers energy consumption and the
  emission of carbon dioxide, while carbon sequestration is raised though the
  increase in soil organic matter (SOM). Under conservation tillage, a richer
  soil biota develops that can improve nutrient recycling and this may also
  help combat crop pests and diseases. The greater availability of crop
  residues and weed seeds improves food supplies for insects, birds and small
  mammals. All these aspects are reviewed but detailed information on the
  environmental benefits of conservation tillage is sparse and disparate from
  European studies. No detailed studies have been conducted at the catchment
  scale in Europe, therefore some findings must be treated with caution until
  they can be verified at a larger scale and for a greater range of climatic,
  cropping and soil conditions. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.%

    Spliced alignment plays a central role in the precise identification of
  eukaryotic gene structures. Even though many spliced alignment programs have
  been developed, recent rapid progress in DNA sequencing technologies demands
  further improvements in software tools. Benchmarking algorithms under various
  conditions is an indispensable task for the development of better software;
  however, there is a dire lack of appropriate datasets usable for benchmarking
  spliced alignment programs. In this study, we have constructed two types of
  datasets: simulated sequence datasets and actual cross-species datasets. The
  datasets are designed to correspond to various real situations, i.e.
  divergent eukaryotic species, different types of reference sequences, and the
  wide divergence between query and target sequences. In addition, we have
  developed an extended version of our program Spaln, which incorporates two
  additional features to the scoring scheme of the original version, and
  examined this extended version, Spaln2, together with the original Spaln and
  other representative aligners based on our benchmark datasets. Although the
  effects of the modifications are not individually striking, Spaln2 is
  consistently most accurate and reasonably fast in most practical cases,
  especially for plants and fungi and for increasingly divergent pairs of
  target and query sequences. Â© 2012 The Author(s).%

    Effective policies to halt biodiversity loss require knowing which
  anthropogenic drivers are the most important direct causes. Whereas previous
  knowledge has been limited in scope and rigor, here we statistically
  synthesize empirical comparisons of recent driver impacts found through a
  wide-ranging review. We show that land/sea use change has been the dominant
  direct driver of recent biodiversity loss worldwide. Direct exploitation of
  natural resources ranks second and pollution third; climate change and
  invasive alien species have been significantly less important than the top
  two drivers. The oceans, where direct exploitation and climate change
  dominate, have a different driver hierarchy from land and fresh water. It
  also varies among types of biodiversity indicators. For example, climate
  change is a more important driver of community composition change than of
  changes in species populations. Stopping global biodiversity loss requires
  policies and actions to tackle all the major drivers and their interactions,
  not some of them in isolation.%

    The unprecedented rate of extinction calls for efficient use of genetics to
  help conserve biodiversity. Several recent genomic and simulation-based
  studies have argued that the field of conservation biology has placed too
  much focus on conserving genome-wide genetic variation, and that the field
  should instead focus on managing the subset of functional genetic variation
  that is thought to affect fitness. Here, we critically evaluate the
  feasibility and likely benefits of this approach in conservation. We find
  that population genetics theory and empirical results show that conserving
  genome-wide genetic variation is generally the best approach to prevent
  inbreeding depression and loss of adaptive potential from driving populations
  toward extinction. Focusing conservation efforts on presumably functional
  genetic variation will only be feasible occasionally, often misleading, and
  counterproductive when prioritized over genome-wide genetic variation. Given
  the increasing rate of habitat loss and other environmental changes, failure
  to recognize the detrimental effects of lost genome-wide genetic variation on
  long-term population viability will only worsen the biodiversity crisis.%

    We estimated the spontaneous mutation rate in Heliconius melpomene by
  genome sequencing of a pair of parents and 30 of their offspring, based on
  the ratio of number of de novo heterozygotes to the number of callable
  site-individuals. We detected nine new mutations, each one affecting a single
  site in a single offspring. This yields an estimated mutation rate of 2.9 Ã
  10-9 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 Ã 10-9-5.5 Ã 10-9), which is similar to
  recent estimates in Drosophila melanogaster, the only other insect species in
  which the mutation rate has been directly estimated. We infer that recent
  effective population size of H. melpomene is about 2 million, a substantially
  lower value than its census size, suggesting a role for natural selection
  reducing diversity. We estimate that H. melpomene diverged from its
  MÃ¼llerian comimic H. erato about 6 Ma, a somewhat later date than estimates
  based on a local molecular clock.%

    In natural populations, it is expected that there is a constant supply of
  mutations in each generation. These mutations may have different persistence
  depending on their fitnesses, but collectively, they constitute the ultimate
  source of genetic variability in the populations. Since the maintenance of
  genetic variability is an important subject of study in population genetics,
  it may be worthwhile to investigate, using various models, the effect of
  mutation on the genetic variability. For example, KIMURA and CROW (1964)
  studied the number of alleles maintained in a finite population, assuming
  that each mutant is an allele not preexisting in the population. In the
  present paper I will use a different model and will investigate the num- ber
  of heterozygous sites per individual and some related quantities that
  represent the statistical properties of the mutant frequency distribution,
  assuming that a very large number of independent sites are available for
  mutation. In this paper, âsiteâ refers to a single nucleotide pair,
  although the theory is still appropriate to a small group of nucleotides,
  such as a codon.%

    Studies have reported widespread declines in terrestrial insect abundances
  in recent years1â4, but trends in other biodiversity metrics are less
  clear-cut5â7. Here we examined long-term trends in 923 terrestrial insect
  assemblages monitored in 106 studies, and found concomitant declines in
  abundance and species richness. For studies that were resolved to species
  level (551 sites in 57 studies), we observed a decline in the number of
  initially abundant species through time, but not in the number of very rare
  species. At the population level, we found that species that were most
  abundant at the start of the time series showed the strongest average
  declines (corrected for regression-to-the-mean effects). Rarer species were,
  on average, also declining, but these were offset by increases of other
  species. Our results suggest that the observed decreases in total insect
  abundance2 can mostly be explained by widespread declines of formerly
  abundant species. This counters the common narrative that biodiversity loss
  is mostly characterized by declines of rare species8,9. Although our results
  suggest that fundamental changes are occurring in insect assemblages, it is
  important to recognize that they represent only trends from those locations
  for which sufficient long-term data are available. Nevertheless, given the
  importance of abundant species in ecosystems10, their general declines are
  likely to have broad repercussions for food webs and ecosystem functioning.%

    Most crop-visiting species are needed to ensure high levels of crop
  pollination In a 1991 experiment that would be unlikely to pass a
  human-subject review today, eight intrepid adventurers were enclosed in a
  hermetically sealed structure (Biosphere 2), along with 3000 species of
  plants and animals and several habitats, including a coral reef, rainforest,
  mangrove, and wetland. However, most vertebrates and all pollinating insects
  went extinct, whereas ants and cockroaches multiplied. Carbon dioxide

    Summary: BWA-MEM is a new alignment algorithm for aligning sequence reads
  or long query sequences against a large reference genome such as human. It
  automatically chooses between local and end-to-end alignments, supports
  paired-end reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to
  sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from
  70bp to a few megabases. For mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better
  performance than several state-of-art read aligners to date. Availability and
  implementation: BWA-MEM is implemented as a component of BWA, which is
  available at http://github.com/lh3/bwa. Contact: hengli@broadinstitute.org%

    Motivation: Recent advances in sequencing technologies promise ultra-long
  reads of ~100 kb in average, full-length mRNA or cDNA reads in high
  throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in length. Existing alignment
  programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which
  presses for the development of new alignment algorithms. Results: Minimap2 is
  a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against
  a large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of â¥100 bp
  in length, â¥1 kb genomic reads at error rate ~15%, full-length noisy Direct
  RNA or cDNA reads and assembly contigs or closely related full chromosomes of
  hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs
  concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces new
  heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3â4 times as fast as
  mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is â¥30 times
  faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing
  most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.%

    Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring
  expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for
  estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit
  direct estimates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives.
  Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial
  insects (Drosophila: 2.8Ã 10-9 per bp per haploid genome per generation;
  Heliconius: 2.9Ã 10-9) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4Ã
  10-9). Might the honeybee's rate be 20% higher because it has an
  exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or
  indirectly mutagenicff To address this possibility, we provide a direct
  estimate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), this
  being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination
  rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much
  lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no
  significant difference in the mutation rates: we estimate for bumblebees a
  rate of 3.6Ã 10-9 per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence
  intervals 2.38Ã 10-9 and 5.37Ã 10-9) which is just 5% higher than the
  estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation
  per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct
  coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the
  effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species
  differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate
  constancy of the mutation rate in insects.%

    This study offers a first-of-its-kind investigation into the spatial and
  temporal transformation of agricultural land use and expansion in crops and
  livestock at national scale during the middle and latter half of the 19th
  century. We introduce an innovative methodological framework that combines
  historical data with advanced spatial analysis to trace and map the evolution
  of frontiers of agricultural land use changes, illustrating Denmark's
  agricultural evolution towards the modern era. Our research uncovers critical
  shifts in cropland, grazing land, and livestock density offering
  unprecedented insights into the mechanisms driving agricultural expansion and
  intensification. The mechanisms driving this expansion and their potential
  impact on contemporary agroecological challenges linked to land use
  intensification are explored. Our results point to a significant broadening
  and shifting of land use frontiers offering a historical perspective on
  agricultural land use. This sets the stage for promoting the analysis of
  drivers of change and gaining insights into how landscape development could
  be steered into an environmentally and societally more desirable and
  sustainable direction tackling present-day agroecological challenges.%

    Finding new protein-coding genes is one of the most important goals of
  eukaryotic genome sequencing projects. However, genomic organization of novel
  eukaryotic genomes is diverse and ab initio gene finding tools tuned up for
  previously studied species are rarely suitable for efficacious gene hunting
  in DNA sequences of a new genome. Gene identification methods based on cDNA
  and expressed sequence tag (EST) mapping to genomic DNA or those using
  alignments to closely related genomes rely either on existence of abundant
  cDNA and EST data and/ or availability on reference genomes. Conventional
  statistical ab initio methods require large training sets of validated genes
  for estimating gene model parameters. In practice, neither one of these types
  of data may be available in sufficient amount until rather late stages of the
  novel genome sequencing. Nevertheless, we have shown that gene finding in
  eukaryotic genomes could be carried out in parallel with statistical models
  estimation directly from yet anonymous genomic DNA. The suggested method of
  parallelization of gene prediction with the model parameters estimation
  follows the path of the iterative Viterbi training. Rounds of genomic
  sequence labeling into coding and non-coding regions are followed by the
  rounds of model parameters estimation. Several dynamically changing
  restrictions on the possible range of model parameters are added to filter
  out fluctuations in the initial steps of the algorithm that could redirect
  the iteration process away from the biologically relevant point in parameter
  space. Tests on well-studied eukaryotic genomes have shown that the new
  method performs comparably or better than conventional methods where the
  supervised model training precedes the gene prediction step. Several novel
  genomes have been analyzed and biologically interesting findings are
  discussed. Thus, a self-training algorithm that had been assumed feasible
  only for prokaryotic genomes has now been developed for ab initio eukaryotic
  gene identification. Â© The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University

    Although extensive work has been done on the relationship between
  population size and the risk of extinction due to demographic and
  environmental stochasticity, the role of genetic deterioration in the
  extinction process is poorly understood. We develop a general theoretical
  approach for evaluating the risk of small populations to extinction via the
  accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations, and we support this with
  extensive computer simulations. Unlike previous attempts to model the genetic
  consequences of small population size, our approach is genetically explicit
  and fully accounts for the mutations inherited by a founder population as
  well as those introduced by subsequent mutation. Application of empirical
  estimates of the properties of spontaneous deleterious mutations leads to the
  conclusion that populations with effective sizes smaller than 100 (and actual
  sizes smaller than 1,000) are highly vulnerable to extinction via a
  mutational meltdown on timescales of approximately 100 generations. We point
  out a number of reasons why this is likely to be an overly optimistic view.
  Thus, from a purely genetic perspective, current management policies that
  provide formal protection to species only after they have dwindled to
  100-1,000 individuals are inadequate. A doubling of the deleterious mutation
  rate, as can result from the release of mutagenic pollutants by human
  activity, is expected to reduce the longevity of a population by about 50%.
  As some investigators have previously suggested, the genetic load of a
  population can be readily purged by intentional inbreeding. However, this
  effect is at best transient, as intentional inbreeding can only enhance the
  probability of fixation of deleterious alleles, and those alleles that are
  purged are rapidly replaced with new mutations.%

    Questions: Land-use change is a key driver of biodiversity change. Delayed
  biotic responses to land-use change impede the establishment of causal links
  between specific anthropogenic changes and resulting biodiversity change.
  Therefore, we aimed at investigating changes to plant species pools: (a) at
  time scales long enough to encompass past land-use changes, even changes that
  have ceased from collective memory; and (b) at spatial scales wide enough to
  encompass landscape-wide changes to habitat quantity and quality. Location:
  Denmark, 10 regions in the range 54Â°3â²â56Â°7â²Â N and
  10Â°4â²â12Â°4â²Â E. Methods: We assessed changes to regional plant
  species pools over ca 140Â years by comparing high-quality legacy data to
  recent re-surveys in ten Danish regions. To identify anthropogenic drivers of
  plant compositional change, we assessed ecological properties of winning and
  losing plant species and compared observed biotic changes to land-cover data
  spatially and temporally matching the regional flora data. Results: Winner
  species were strongly associated with shaded, fertile, well-drained
  conditions. Loser species were associated with open, infertile conditions
  with either moist or xeric soils. The major land-use changes driving biotic
  change were: (a) drainage of moist and wet biotopes; (b) active afforestation
  and passive scrub overgrowth due to ceased grazing; and (c) landscape-wide
  increased nutrient availability. However, the magnitude of increase or
  decrease in the area of a land-cover type was a poor predictor of the number
  of habitat-associated winner or loser species. This suggests that degradation
  of extant biotopes and/or low quality of new biotopes limits plant species
  richness, in particular of habitat specialists. Conclusions: We demonstrate a
  displacement of plant ecospace towards mesic, shaded and fertile conditions,
  with profound effects on plant diversity, and mainly driven by intensified
  agricultural/silvicultural use of the landscape matrix, which has strongly
  affected the main plant habitats in scattered semi-natural fragments.%

    Since the introduction of agriculture, 4000 BC, the Danish region has
  witnessed a change from almost complete woodland cover to the landscapes
  present at AD 1800 that were dominated by heathland, cultivated areas,
  grassland or patchy woodland. We used a combination of pollen records and
  landscape data to identify the timing and major pathways of this land-cover
  transformation. 2 Pollen assemblages dated to about AD 1800 were collected
  from 20 Danish lakes with a median size of 26 ha. Fossil pollen records for
  the interval 4500 BC - AD 1800 were compiled from 11 of these 20 sites and
  divided into 11 time units corresponding to major archaeological periods. 3
  Land cover around the 20 sites was digitized from historical maps, dating
  from the same period as the pollen assemblages. Percentage cover of woodland,
  heathland, wetland and agricultural land within 2- and 5-km radii were
  calculated (calculations were also made within 10- and 20-km radii for
  woodland). Environmental data within 5 km of each site were collected from
  soil, geological and topographical maps. 4 The AD 1800 pollen assemblages
  formed three clusters characterized by either a dominance (> 20%) of Calluna
  (group A), a dominance (> 10%) of Fagus (group B) and a dominance of Poaceae
  with Fagus < 10% and Calluna < 20% (group C). Respectively, these clusters
  correspond well to sites where heathland is the dominant land cover, where it
  has a strong woodland element and where agricultural land is dominant with
  little, if any, woodland or heathland. 5 Direct and indirect ordinations
  suggest that the main variation in the pollen assemblages from the 20 sites
  is related to gradients in soil clay content and in the degree of landscape
  openness. Land-cover data from within a 2-km radius account for almost as
  much of the variation in pollen data as do land-cover data from within a 5-km
  radius. 6 Indirect ordinations of AD 1800 samples with the fossil records as
  passive samples reveal that long-term records from cluster B sites (the '1800
  woodland type') show little landscape variation through time. Samples from
  cluster C sites (the '1800 agricultural area type') show the same starting
  point as cluster B but their development diverge to more open landscapes.
  Cluster A sites (the '1800 heathland type') either develop directly from
  rather wooded landscapes to heathland or by heathland expansion after initial
  development towards landscapes producing cluster C type pollen assemblages. 7
  Chord distances between the AD 1800 sample and the (pre)historic samples at
  10 long-term sites strongly suggest that the between-site variation in
  land-cover characteristic of the early 19th century was already in existence
  by 1000 BC. Direct ordination of the fossil samples using woodland cover at
  AD 1800 as an environmental variable and soil clay content as a covariable
  also indicates that the macro-scale land-cover patterns of the historical
  cultural landscape in Denmark has been present for more than 3000 years.%

    Soil life supports the functioning and biodiversity of terrestrial
  ecosystems. Springtails (Collembola) are among the most abundant soil
  arthropods regulating soil fertility and flow of energy through above- and
  belowground food webs. However, the global distribution of springtail
  diversity and density, and how these relate to energy fluxes remains unknown.
  Here, using a global dataset representing 2470 sites, we estimate theÂ total
  soil springtail biomass at 27.5 megatons carbon, which is threefold higher
  than wild terrestrial vertebrates, and record peak densities up to 2 million
  individuals per square meter in the tundra. Despite a 20-fold biomass
  difference between the tundra and the tropics, springtail energy use
  (community metabolism) remains similar across the latitudinal gradient, owing
  to the changes in temperature with latitude. Neither springtail density nor
  community metabolism is predicted by local species richness, which is high in
  the tropics, but comparably high in some temperate forests and even tundra.
  Changes in springtail activity may emerge from latitudinal gradients in
  temperature, predation and resource limitation in soil communities.
  Contrasting relationships of biomass, diversity and activity of springtail
  communities with temperature suggest that climate warming will alter
  fundamental soil biodiversity metrics in different directions, potentially
  restructuring terrestrial food webs and affecting soil functioning.%

    Springtails (Collembola) inhabit soils from the Arctic to the Antarctic and
  comprise an estimated ~32% of all terrestrial arthropods on Earth. Here, we
  present aÂ global, spatially-explicit database on springtail communities that
  includes 249,912 occurrences from 44,999 samples and 2,990 sites. These data
  are mainly raw sample-level records at the species level collected
  predominantly from private archives of the authors that were
  quality-controlled and taxonomically-standardised. Despite covering all
  continents, most of the sample-level data come from the European continent
  (82.5% of all samples) and represent four habitats: woodlands (57.4%),
  grasslands (14.0%), agrosystems (13.7%) and scrublands (9.0%). We included
  sampling by soil layers, and across seasons and years, representing temporal
  and spatial within-site variation in springtail communities. We also provided
  data use and sharing guidelines and R code to facilitate the use of the
  database by other researchers. This data paper describes a static version of
  the database at the publication date, but the database will be further
  expanded to include underrepresented regions and linked with trait data.%

    Motivation: Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic
  features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for
  overlaps between features with existing webbased methods is complicated by
  the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing
  technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex
  questions of these data in an efficient manner. Results: This article
  introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and
  annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General
  Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of
  sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are
  extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g.
  next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome
  annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with
  standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as
  pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic
  datasets. Availability and implementation: BEDTools was written in C++.

    \field{abstract}{%
    Anthropogenic habitat loss is widely recognized as a primary environmental
  concern. By contrast, debates on the effects of habitat fragmentation
  persist. To facilitate overcoming these debates, here we: (i) review the
  state of the literature on habitat fragmentation, finding widespread
  confusion and stigma; (ii) identify consequences of this for biodiversity
  conservation and ecosystem management; and (iii) suggest ways in which
  research can move forward to resolve these problems. Confusion is evident
  from the 25 most-cited fragmentation articles published between 2017 and
  2021. These articles use five distinct concepts of habitat fragmentation,
  only one of which clearly distinguishes habitat fragmentation from habitat
  area and other factors (âfragmentation per seâ). Stigmatization is
  evident from our new findings that fragmentation papers are more charged with
  negative sentiments when compared to papers from other subfields in the
  environmental sciences, and that fragmentation papers with more negative
  sentiments are cited more. While most empirical studies of habitat
  fragmentation per se find neutral or positive effects on species and
  biodiversity outcomes, which implies that small habitat patches have a high
  cumulative value, confusion and stigma in reporting and discussing such
  results have led to suboptimal habitat protection policy. For example,
  government agencies, conservation organizations, and land trusts impose
  minimum habitat patch sizes on habitat protection. Given the high cumulative
  value of small patches, such policies mean that many opportunities for
  conservation are being missed. Our review highlights the importance of
  reducing confusion and stigma in habitat fragmentation research. To this end,
  we propose implementing study designs in which multiple sample landscapes are
  selected across independent gradients of habitat amount and fragmentation,
  measured as patch density. We show that such designs are possible for forest
  habitat across Earth's biomes. As such study designs are adopted, and as
  language becomes more precise, we expect that confusion and stigma in habitat
  fragmentation research will dissipate. We also expect important breakthroughs
  in understanding the situations where effects of habitat fragmentation per se
  are neutral, positive, or negative, and the reasons for these differences.
  Ultimately this will improve efficacy of area-based conservation policies, to
  the benefit of biodiversity and people.%

    The lucerne flea, Sminthurus viridis (Collembola: Sminthuridae) (L.) is a
  major pest of broadacre agriculture across southern Australia. Few molecular
  studies have been conducted on S. viridis and none have examined its
  population genetics, despite the importance for developing effective control
  strategies. Here, we characterize the genetic structure of Australian
  populations using three allozyme and eight microsatellite loci, as well as
  sequencing a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I gene. We
  found that S. viridis in Australia are diploid, sexually reproducing and
  exhibit significant population structure as a result of limited gene flow.
  Despite significant differentiation between populations, there was very low
  cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequence variation, indicating the
  presence of a single species in Australia. The observed structure only
  marginally complied with an 'isolation by distance' model with human-mediated
  long-distance dispersal likely occurring. Allozymes and microsatellites gave
  very similar FST estimates, although differences found for novel alternative
  estimates of differentiation suggest that the allozymes did not capture the
  full extent of the population structure. These results highlight that control
  strategies may need to vary for locally adapted S. viridis populations and
  strategies aimed at limiting the spread of any future pesticide resistance
  will need to manage the effects of human-mediated dispersal.%

    Genetic diversity is the amount of variation observed between DNA sequences
  from distinct individuals of a given species. This pivotal concept of
  population genetics has implications for species health, domestication,
  management and conservation. Levels of genetic diversity seem to vary greatly
  in natural populations and species, but the determinants of this variation,
  and particularly the relative influences of species biology and ecology
  versus population history, are still largely mysterious. Here we show that
  the diversity of a species is predictable, and is determined in the first
  place by its ecological strategy. We investigated the genome-wide diversity
  of 76 non-model animal species by sequencing the transcriptome of two to ten
  individuals in each species. The distribution of genetic diversity between
  species revealed no detectable influence of geographic range or invasive
  status but was accurately predicted by key species traits related to parental
  investment: long-lived or low-fecundity species with brooding ability were
  genetically less diverse than short-lived or highly fecund ones. Our analysis
  demonstrates the influence of long-term life-history strategies on species
  response to short-term environmental perturbations, a result with immediate
  implications for conservation policies.%

    Insects and other arthropods are central to terrestrial ecosystems.
  However, data are lacking regarding their global population abundance. We

  the soil biomass, much more than ants at â10%. Our estimate for the global

  combined dry biomass of all terrestrial arthropods at â300 Mt (un-certainty
  range, 100 to 500), similar to the mass of humanity and its livestock. These
  estimates enhance the quantitative understanding of arthropods in terrestrial

    Background: Climate oscillations in the Cenozoic reduced species richness
  and genetic diversity of terrestrial and aquatic animals and plants in
  central and northern Europe. The most abundant arthropods in temperate soils
  are Collembola that live in almost any soil-related habitat. Extant species
  show little morphological variation to Eocene fossils, suggesting persistence
  of species in stable habitats for millions of years. Collembola are able to
  evade adverse climatic conditions by moving into deeper soil layers and are
  tolerant to frost and draught. If these adaptations sufficed for surviving
  glacial periods remains open and needs to be investigated in a
  phylogeographic context, i.e. investigating spatial structure on molecular
  level. We investigated the molecular variation of three common species of
  Collembola at a pan-European scale to identify glacial refuges and
  post-glacial colonization patterns with three genetic markers. Results: All
  genes revealed remarkable genetic structure between but not within
  populations, suggesting density dependent processes for establishment of
  populations (founder-takes-all principle), which is common for European
  animals and plants. In contrast to the post-glacial recolonization patterns
  of many aboveground organisms, divergence times of most geographic lineages
  indicate preservation of genetic structure since the Miocene. Conclusions:
  Collembola survived severe climatic changes including those during Quatenary
  glaciation and kept high genetic variance across Europe. Likely the buffering
  of temperature oscilliations in soil and the ability to evade adverse
  climatic conditions due to cold-tolerance and horizontal migration enabled
  Collembola to evade strong selective pressure of abiotic forces.%

    Background: As high-throughput sequencing platforms produce longer and
  longer reads, sequences generated from short inserts, such as those obtained
  from fossil and degraded material, are increasingly expected to contain
  adapter sequences. Efficient adapter trimming algorithms are also needed to
  process the growing amount of data generated per sequencing run. Findings: We
  introduce AdapterRemoval v2, a major revision of AdapterRemoval v1, which
  introduces (i) striking improvements in throughput, through the use of single

  multi-threading support, (ii) the ability to handle datasets containing reads

  demultiplexing and adapter trimming, (iv) the ability to reconstruct adapter
  sequences from paired-end reads for poorly documented data sets, and (v)

  compares favorably with existing tools, while offering superior throughput to

    The vast majority of the energy and nutrients that is obtained by plants
  eventually becomes incorporated in dead organic matter or detritus (78, 108).
  Both the disappearance of this material (i.e. decomposition) and the release
  of the inorganic elements that are bound in detritus (i.e. mineralization)
  are critical to the continued productivity of terrestrial ecosystems (95).
  The accuÂ­ mulation of dead organic matter not only locks away plant
  nutrients, but in certain ecosystems it reduces the amount of energy
  available for plant metaboÂ­ lism and photosynthesis because of the
  insulating and shading effects of litter (41, 66). As a result, terrestrial
  decomposition and mineralization processes have been the subject of a
  considerable scientific effort by biochemists, soil scientists,
  bacteriologists, mycologists, invertebrate zoologists, and ecoloÂ­ gists. A
  massive literature on this subject is available, and two extensive reviews
  have been published in the last decade (27, 93). The concept that soil fauna
  regulates the decomposition process has become increasingly popular (7, 22,
  23, 117) in spite of the fact that the amount of soil metabolism (C02
  production) that can be attributed to all soil animals is 10% or less of the
  total amount (12, 71, 72, 77). Fungi and bacteria are directly responsible
  for most of the organic matter breakdown, but a diverse assemblage of
  protozoans, nematodes, annelids, and arthropods greatly influence the
  functioning of the decomposer flora as a direct and indirect result of their
  feeding activities. This review examines the importance of one component of
  the soil fauna, the microarthropods, in decomposition and mineralization
  processes.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Recent reports of local extinctions of arthropod species1, and of massive
  declines in arthropod biomass2, point to land-use intensification as a major
  driver of decreasing biodiversity. However, to our knowledge, there are no
  multisite time series of arthropod occurrences across gradients of land-use
  intensity with which to confirm causal relationships. Moreover, it remains
  unclear which land-use types and arthropod groups are affected, and whether
  the observed declines in biomass and diversity are linked to one another.
  Here we analyse data from more than 1Â million individual arthropods (about
  2,700Â species), from standardized inventories taken between 2008 and 2017 at
  150Â grassland and 140Â forest sites in 3Â regions of Germany. Overall gamma
  diversity in grasslands and forests decreased over time, indicating loss of
  species across sites and regions. In annually sampled grasslands, biomass,
  abundance and number of species declined by 67%, 78% and 34%, respectively.
  The decline was consistent across trophic levels and mainly affected rare
  species; its magnitude was independent of local land-use intensity. However,
  sites embedded in landscapes with a higher cover of agricultural land showed
  a stronger temporal decline. In 30Â forest sites with annual inventories,
  biomass and species numberâbut not abundanceâdecreased by 41% and 36%,
  respectively. This was supported by analyses of all forest sites sampled in
  three-year intervals. The decline affected rare and abundant species, and
  trends differed across trophic levels. Our results show that there are
  widespread declines in arthropod biomass, abundance and the number of species
  across trophic levels. Arthropod declines in forests demonstrate that loss is
  not restricted to open habitats. Our results suggest that major drivers of
  arthropod decline act at larger spatial scales, and are (at least for
  grasslands) associated with agriculture at the landscape level. This implies
  that policies need to address the landscape scale to mitigate the negative
  effects of land-use practices.%

    Background: Pacific Biosciences HiFi read technology is currently the
  industry standard for high accuracy long-read sequencing that has been widely
  adopted by large sequencing and assembly initiatives for generation of de
  novo assemblies in non-model organisms. Though adapter contamination
  filtering is routine in traditional short-read analysis pipelines, it has not
  been widely adopted for HiFi workflows. Results: Analysis of 55 publicly
  available HiFi datasets revealed that a read-sanitation step to remove
  sequence artifacts derived from PacBio library preparation from read pools is
  necessary as adapter sequences can be erroneously integrated into assemblies.
  Conclusions: Here we describe the nature of adapter contaminated reads, their
  consequences in assembly, and present HiFiAdapterFilt, a simple and memory
  efficient solution for removing adapter contaminated reads prior to
  assembly.%

    The shift from outcrossing to selfing is common in flowering plants, but
  the genomic consequences and the speed at which they emerge remain poorly
  understood. An excellent model for understanding the evolution of self
  fertilization is provided by Capsella rubella, which became self compatible
  <200,000 years ago. We report a C. rubella reference genome sequence and
  compare RNA expression and polymorphism patterns between C. rubella and its
  outcrossing progenitor Capsella grandiflora. We found a clear shift in the
  expression of genes associated with flowering phenotypes, similar to that
  seen in Arabidopsis, in which self fertilization evolved about 1 million
  years ago. Comparisons of the two Capsella species showed evidence of rapid
  genome-wide relaxation of purifying selection in C. rubella without a
  concomitant change in transposable element abundance. Overall we document
  that the transition to selfing may be typified by parallel shifts in gene
  expression, along with a measurable reduction of purifying selection. Â© 2013

    Motivation: Computational annotation of protein coding genes in genomic DNA
  is a widely used and essential tool for analyzing newly sequenced genomes.
  However, current methods suffer from inaccuracy and do poorly with certain
  types of genes. Including additional sources of evidence of the existence and
  structure of genes can improve the quality of gene predictions. For many
  eukaryotic genomes, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are available as evidence
  for genes. Related genomes that have been sequenced, annotated, and aligned
  to the target genome provide evidence of existence and structure of genes.
  Results: We incorporate several different evidence sources into the gene
  finder AUGUSTUS. The sources of evidence are gene and transcript annotations
  from related species syntenically mapped to the target genome using TRANSMAP,
  evolutionary conservation of DNA, mRNA and ESTs of the target species, and
  retroposed genes. The predictions include alternative splice variants where
  evidence supports it. Using only ESTs we were able to correctly predict at
  least one splice form exactly correct in 57% of human genes. Also using
  evidence from other species and human mRNAs, this number rises to 77%.
  Syntenic mapping is well-suited to annotate genomes closely related to
  genomes that are already annotated or for which extensive transcript evidence
  is available. Native cDNA evidence is most helpful when the alignments are
  used as compound information rather than independent positionwise
  information. Â© 2008 The Author(s).%

    Understanding the effects of landscape modification on gene flow of fauna
  is central to informing conservation strategies that promote functional
  landscape connectivity and population persistence. We explored the effects of
  large-scale habitat loss and fragmentation on spatial and temporal patterns
  of gene flow in a threatened Australian woodland bird: the Grey-crowned
  Babbler Pomatostomus temporalis. Using microsatellite data, we (1)
  investigated historical (i.e., pre-fragmentation) and contemporary (i.e.,
  post-fragmentation) levels of gene flow among subpopulations and/or regions,
  (2) identified first-generation migrants and likely dispersal events, (3)
  tested for signatures of genetic bottlenecks, (4) estimated contemporary and
  historical effective population sizes, and (5) explored the relative
  influences of drift and migration in shaping contemporary population
  structure. Results indicated that the functional connectivity of landscapes
  used by the Grey-crowned Babbler is severely compromised in the study area.
  The proportion of individuals that were recent immigrants among all
  subpopulations were low. Habitat fragmentation has led to a clear division
  between subpopulations in the east and west, and the patterns of gene flow
  exchange between these two regions have changed over time. The effective
  population size estimates for these two regions are now well below that
  required for long-term population viability (Ne < 100). Demographic history
  models indicate that genetic drift was a greater influence on subpopulations
  than gene flow, and most subpopulations show signatures of bottlenecks.
  Translocations to promote gene flow and boost genetic diversity in the short
  term and targeted habitat restoration to improve landscape functional
  connectivity in the long term represent promising conservation management
  strategies that will likely have benefits for many other woodland bird
  species.%

    1. Generalist arthropod predators act as natural enemies of insect pests in
  agroecosystems. Crop management activities may cause a reduction in arthropod
  densities, either directly through mortality and emigration, or indirectly
  through habitat disruption. Our aim was to quantify direct mortality caused
  by mechanical crop treatments. For some treatments, we also quantified
  emigration and other indirect effects, such as population declines caused by
  the impact of habitat deterioration on reproduction and survival. 2. Direct
  mortality was determined by measuring predator densities simultaneously in
  control and treatment plots using closed emergence traps immediately
  following a mechanical treatment. Treatments consisted of the following crop
  management activities: ploughing, non-inversion tillage, superficial soil
  loosening, mechanical weed control and grass cutting. Predator densities were
  measured a second time 5-26 days after treatment to quantify emigration and
  indirect effects. 3. All treatments had a negative influence on one or more
  arthropod taxa. Direct mortality caused a 25-60% reduction in arthropod
  densities. Overall, spiders were more vulnerable to mechanical crop treatment
  than carabid and staphylinid beetles. Intensive soil cultivation, such as
  ploughing and soil loosening, did not kill more arthropods than weed
  harrowing and grass cutting. 4. We estimated the cumulative effects of
  mortality, emigration and indirect effects 3 weeks following treatment. The
  cumulative effect was greater than direct arthropod mortality, suggesting
  delayed effects of habitat disruption. 5. Grass cutting caused spiders and
  staphylinid beetles to move out of the crop, except in one case when the
  grass was left to dry, suggesting an important role of organic material or
  structural elements for arthropod persistence. Our results also suggest that
  arthropod predators aggregate in undisturbed or less disrupted habitats. 6.
  Synthesis and applications. Mechanical operations in arable crops and grass
  cutting cause mortality and emigration of generalist arthropod predators,
  especially spiders. Effects can be species-specific and are likely to be
  affected by the timing of management. In grassland, cutting and removal have
  greater adverse impacts than leaving cuttings that contribute to habitat
  structure. Adjacent, less-disturbed refuge areas are colonized by predators
  following husbandry events, demonstrating significant spatial dynamics among
  farmland arthropods. The negative effects of crop husbandry operations might
  be mitigated by the provision of refuge areas within and adjacent to fields
  and by maintaining crop and landscape diversity.%

    Population genetic structure is determined both by current processes and
  historical events. Current processes include gene flow, which is largely
  influenced by the migration capacity of a species. Historical events are, for
  example, glaciation periods, which have had a major impact on the
  distribution of many species. Species with a low capacity or tendency to move
  about or disperse often exhibit clear spatial genetic structures, whereas
  mobile species mostly show less spatial genetic differentiation. In this
  paper we report on the genetic structure of a small, wingless arthropod
  species (Orchesella cincta: Collembola) in Europe. For this purpose we used
  mtDNA COII sequences and AFLP markers. We show that large genetic differences
  exist between populations of O. cincta, as expected from O. cincta's
  winglessness and sedentary lifestyle. Despite the fact that most variability
  was observed within populations (59%), a highly significant amount of AFLP
  variation (25%) was observed between populations from northwestern Europe,
  central Europe and Italy. This suggests that gene flow among regions is
  extremely low, which is additionally supported by the lack of shared mtDNA
  alleles between regions. Based on the genetic variation and sequence
  differences observed we conclude that the subdivision occurred long before
  the last glaciation periods. Although the populations still interbreed in the
  lab, we assume that in the long term the genetic isolation of these regions
  may lead to speciation processes. Â© 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.%

    Disturbance regimes are changing rapidly, and the consequences of such
  changes for ecosystems and linked social-ecological systems will be profound.
  This paper synthesizes current understanding of disturbance with an emphasis
  on fundamental contributions to contemporary landscape and ecosystem ecology,
  then identifies future research priorities. Studies of disturbance led to
  insights about heterogeneity, scale, and thresholds in space and time and
  catalyzed new paradigms in ecology. Because they create vegetation patterns,
  disturbances also establish spatial patterns of many ecosystem processes on
  the landscape. Drivers of global change will produce new spatial patterns,
  altered disturbance regimes, novel trajectories of change, and surprises.
  Future disturbances will continue to provide valuable opportunities for
  studying pattern-process interactions. Changing disturbance regimes will
  produce acute changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services over the short
  (years to decades) and long term (centuries and beyond). Future research
  should address questions related to (1) disturbances as catalysts of rapid
  ecological change, (2) interactions among disturbances, (3) relationships
  between disturbance and society, especially the intersection of land use and
  disturbance, and (4) feedbacks from disturbance to other global drivers.
  Ecologists should make a renewed and concerted effort to understand and
  anticipate the causes and consequences of changing disturbance regimes. Â©

    Insect pollinators of crops and wild plants are under threat globally and
  their decline or loss could have profound economic and environmental
  consequences. Here, we argue that multiple anthropogenic pressures -
  including land-use intensification, climate change, and the spread of alien
  species and diseases - are primarily responsible for insect-pollinator
  declines. We show that a complex interplay between pressures (eg lack of food
  sources, diseases, and pesticides) and biological processes (eg species
  dispersal and interactions) at a range of scales (from genes to ecosystems)
  underpins the general decline in insect-pollinator populations.
  Interdisciplinary research on the nature and impacts of these interactions
  will be needed if human food security and ecosystem function are to be
  preserved. We highlight key areas that require research focus and outline
  some practical steps to alleviate the pressures on pollinators and the
  pollination services they deliver to wild and crop plants. Â© The Ecological

    Insect declines are being reported worldwide for flying, ground, and
  aquatic lineages. Most reports come from western and northern Europe, where
  the insect fauna is well-studied and there are considerable demographic data
  for many taxonomically disparate lineages. Additional cases of faunal losses
  have been noted from Asia, North America, the Arctic, the Neotropics, and
  elsewhere. While this review addresses both species loss and population
  declines, its emphasis is on the latter. Declines of abundant species can be
  especially worrisome, given that they anchor trophic interactions and
  shoulder many of the essential ecosystem services of their respective
  communities. A review of the factors believed to be responsible for observed
  collapses and those perceived to be especially threatening to insects form
  the core of this treatment. In addition to widely recognized threats to
  insect biodiversity, e.g., habitat destruction, agricultural intensification
  (including pesticide use), climate change, and invasive species, this
  assessment highlights a few less commonly considered factors such as
  atmospheric nitrification from the burning of fossil fuels and the effects of
  droughts and changing precipitation patterns. Because the geographic extent
  and magnitude of insect declines are largely unknown, there is an urgent need
  for monitoring efforts, especially across ecological gradients, which will
  help to identify important causal factors in declines. This review also
  considers the status of vertebrate insectivores, reporting bias, challenges
  inherent in collecting and interpreting insect demographic data, and cases of
  increasing insect abundance.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Insects constitute vital components of ecosystems. There is alarming
  evidence for global declines in insect species diversity, abundance, and
  biomass caused by anthropogenic drivers such as habitat degradation or loss,
  agricultural practices, climate change, and environmental pollution. This
  raises important concerns about human food security and ecosystem
  functionality and calls for more research to assess insect population trends
  and identify threatened species and the causes of declines to inform
  conservation strategies. Analysis of genetic diversity is a powerful tool to
  address these goals, but so far animal conservation genetics research has
  focused strongly on endangered vertebrates, devoting less attention to
  invertebrates, such as insects , that constitute most biodiversity. Insects'
  shorter generation times and larger population sizes likely necessitate
  different analytical methods and management strategies. The availability of
  high-quality reference genome assemblies enables population genomics to
  address several key issues. These include precise inference of past
  demographic fluctuations and recent declines , measurement of genetic load
  levels, delineation of evolutionarily significant units and cryptic species,
  and analysis of genetic adaptation to stressors. This enables identification
  of populations that are particularly vulnerable to future threats,
  considering their potential to adapt and evolve. We review the application of
  population genomics to insect conservation and the outlook for averting
  insect declines.%

    The Class Bdelloidea of the Phylum Rotifera is the largest metazoan taxon
  in which males, hermaphrodites, and meiosis are unknown. We conducted a
  molecular genetic test of this indication that bdelloid rotifers may have
  evolved without sexual reproduction or genetic exchange. The test is based on
  the expectation that after millions of years without these processes, genomes
  will no longer contain pairs of closely similar haplotypes and instead will
  contain highly divergent descendants of formerly allelic nucleotide
  sequences. We find that genomes of individual bdelloid rotifers, representing
  four different species, appear to lack pairs of closely similar sequences and
  contain representatives of two ancient lineages that began to diverge before
  the bdelloid radiation many millions of years ago when sexual reproduction
  and genetic exchange may have ceased.%

    Small populations are predicted to have reduced capacity to adapt to
  environmental change for two reasons. First, population genetic models
  indicate that genetic variation and potential response to selection should be
  positively correlated with population size. The empirical support for this
  prediction is mixed: DNA markers usually reveal low heterozygosity in small
  populations, whereas quantitative traits show reduced heritability only in
  the smallest and most inbred populations. Quantitative variation can even
  increase in bottlenecked populations although this effect seems unlikely to
  increase the adaptive potential of populations. Second, individuals in small
  populations have lower fitness owing to environmental stress and genetic
  problems such as inbreeding, which can substantially increase the extinction
  probability of populations in changing environments. This second reason has
  not been included in assessments of critical population size assuring
  evolvability and makes it likely that many small threatened populations have
  a decreased potential for adaptation. Copyright Â© 2006 by Annual Reviews.

    We studied genetic variation and population differentiation in the
  springtail Orchesella cincta L. An earlier approach, using allozymes,
  revealed extremely low variation among and within populations from NW Europe.
  Microsatellite marker analysis showed higher genetic variation than
  allozymes, and agreed with the previously reported low population
  differentiation in the species. Analysis of molecular variance showed that
  genetic variation within populations amounted to 96.5% of the total
  variation, whereas the remaining 3.5% is accounted for by population
  differentiation. Population differentiation, as described by microsatellite
  markers and with the exception of one population, can be explained by an
  isolation by distance. Although the microsatellites are short, viz. only up
  to 12 repeat units, they appear to be useful tools in revealing population
  genetic structures in O. cincta. Â© 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.%

    Insects and other small invertebrates are ubiquitous components of all
  terrestrial and freshwater food webs, but their cumulative biomass is small
  relative to plants and microbes. As a result, it is often assumed that these
  animals make relatively minor contributions to ecosystem processes. Despite
  their small sizes and cumulative biomass, we suggest that these animals may
  commonly have important effects on carbon and nutrient cycling by modulating
  the quality and quantity of resources that enter the detrital food web, with
  consequences at the ecosystem level. These effects can occur through multiple
  pathways, including direct inputs of insect biomass, the transformation of
  detrital biomass, and the indirect effects of predators on herbivores and
  detritivores. In virtually all cases, the ecosystem effects of these pathways
  are ultimately mediated through interactions with plants and soil microbes.
  Merging our understanding of insect, plant and microbial ecology will offer a
  valuable way to better integrate community-level interactions with ecosystem
  processes. Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.%

    The relationship between population size, inbreeding, loss of genetic
  variation and evolutionary potential of fitness traits is still unresolved,
  and large-scale empirical studies testing theoretical expectations are
  surprisingly scarce. Here we present a highly replicated experimental
  evolution setup with 120 lines of Drosophila melanogaster having experienced
  inbreeding caused by low population size for a variable number of
  generations. Genetic variation in inbred lines and in outbred control lines
  was assessed by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) of pooled samples consisting
  of 15 males per line. All lines were reared on a novel stressful medium for
  10 generations during which body mass, productivity, and extinctions were
  scored in each generation. In addition, we investigated egg-to-adult
  viability in the benign and the stressful environments before and after
  rearing at the stressful conditions for 10 generations. We found strong
  positive correlations between levels of genetic variation and evolutionary
  response in all investigated traits, and showed that genomic variation was
  more informative in predicting evolutionary responses than population history
  reflected by expected inbreeding levels. We also found that lines with lower
  genetic diversity were at greater risk of extinction. For viability, the
  results suggested a trade-off in the costs of adapting to the stressful
  environments when tested in a benign environment. This work presents
  convincing support for long-standing evolutionary theory, and it provides
  novel insights into the association between genetic variation and
  evolutionary capacity in a gradient of diversity rather than dichotomous
  inbred/outbred groups.%
